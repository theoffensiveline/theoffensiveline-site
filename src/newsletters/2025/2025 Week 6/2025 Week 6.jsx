                The main headline this week was our Matchup of the Week. This 74.92 point margin was the biggest blowout of this season, and also the biggest blowout in MotW history, surpassing the 2023 week 3 MotW where Hurt Thuggins & the boys (Matt Smith) defeated E.T.N Phone Home (Devan) by 65.08 points. BBCU and Costco Guys were our best and worst teams of the week, respectively, which will almost always result in a massive blowout like this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. let themselves down this week as they had the warmest bench and were the best loser, a combination you hate to see as they could've won their matchup with better management. Lord of the Littles on the other hand had some good luck, getting worst winner in the closest game of the week, with the MVP of the week Cam Skattebo getting them there with 31 points. For the Barkley Brawlers, Cameron Dicker had a revenge game against the meme The Offensive Line posted about him last week as he was the top kicker and had the #2 kicking performance of the season thus far.

            <p>
                This was not a great week, we had no perfect managers and lots of managers in the 70s and 80s for efficiency. The best manager by every metric was BBCU with the most points at the highest efficiency. The worst manager in terms of efficiency was Anthony's Eskimo Brother, and the lowest point total was Costco Guys, but they didn't have a high potential total so they were pretty efficient.

            <p>
                BBCU had a dominant week in their first MotW appearance of the season. The hotdog prophecy wouldn't have let any other result occur in this matchup. They would've won this matchup with just Bijan Robinson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and one of Ladd McConkey, Trey McBride, or Justin Herbert. Only needing 3 players to win your matchup says a lot about your player's performance, but it also says a lot about how poorly the other team performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costco Guys had the first 7 shot MotW loss of the season this week, and only the 4th 7+ shot loss in MotW history. They just couldn't get anything going. The only players that saved them from shots were Brian Thomas and Jake Ferguson. Luckily for them their defense managed to stay positive with just 3 points on the week. They didn't have anything better on their bench either, their top bench player was Evan Engram with 9.9 points.

                BBCU earns their 5th MotW victory of all time, moving up to a tie for 4th with Anthony's Eskimo Brother. Costco Guys is now alone in 3rd all time with 6 MotW losses, but they are 2nd in dogs/shots consumed at 31. They are now one of 4 managers averaging over 5 shots/dogs per loss in MotW.

                Anthony's Eskimo Brother had another rough week this week, putting up only 82.4 points. This poor performance got overshadowed by that of the Costco Guys in MotW, but this one was just as ugly. They only had 3 players break 10 points with their highest scorer at 15.4 points. If the Raiders DEF is your 2nd highest scorer, you know you're in trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barkley Brawlers needed this game to avoid dropping to 2-4, and their team showed up when they needed to. This was a very well rounded performance with 6 players scoring between 13 and 20 points. James Cook and Saquon Barkley were disappointing with just 8.7 points each, but they were still able to get the win thanks to their other players.

                Singing Like Mariah Terry needed to win their own matchup to have a shot at winning survivor this week, and they were able to get the job done. Josh Jacobs and Patrick Mahomes put this team on their backs when it mattered most. They combined for a whopping 63.48 points, over 55% of this teams total points this week. The rest of their team did enough to get the win.
            </p>
            <p>
                WalterPickens had a similar team build, with Christian McCaffrey and George Pickens leading the charge for them. Their other players didn't do enough to get the win though. Justin Fields and JK Dobbins were particularly bad, each scoring under 5 points. Emeka Egbuka getting injured also changed the course of this matchup dramatically since he only ended with 4.4 points too.

                Bye Week Curious had big games from his players that are named after locations this week, and if you lump Indiana Jones in there you can say there were 3 players included. Drake London had 31.8 points and Dallas Goedert had 26 points, both outscoring the top player on their opponent's team this week. They earned their 2nd win of the season and handed their opponent their 2nd loss.

                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. was one start/sit decision away from winning this week, but they started Jauan Jennings and Courtland Sutton over Kayshon Boutte who went off for 26.3 points on their bench. Otherwise their team was pretty solid and they were the best loser this week after scoring the 4th most points of any team.

The other minions were able to score enough points to get them the win, with Jonathan Taylor leading the charge yet again. Taylor could not outscore Swift this week, and Love couldn't outscore Hurts either, but Butker outscored McPherson and they won some other positional matchups to get the win.

                Lord of the Littles has been dominant this season, but this was not a continuation of that dominance. They were able to pull out an ugly win this week thanks to both of their RBs scoring 31 points, Jayden Daniels scoring 21.64 points, and their DEF putting up 13 points. Team mascot Cam Little put up -2 points, but that did not end up breaking the bank for them this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uncle Rico Went Pro had a real shot at a win this week, but their rookie RBs were not up to the task. Bill and Judkins just couldn't get it done on the ground this week, and their receivers couldn't get it done through the air either. A single TD was the difference in this one. This team will reload at WR with Rashee Rice coming off of suspension in week 7.

Bye Week Curious took the biggest jump, up 4 spots to 8th after earning their 2nd victory of the season. Uncle Rico Went Pro moved into last place and have the fewest Play All Wins this season with just 20.

                The divide between good teams and bad teams gets clearer every week. You can see it on the PF/PA chart, the power rankings, and it stands out here too. FFHub has the top 6 teams making the playoffs 80% of the time. WalterPicks is slightly less optimistic, but it still puts the 6 seed WalterPickens at 63% playoff odds. The Barkley Brawlers and Uncle Rico Went Pro appear to be the only teams in the bottom half with real hope of making the playoffs according to WalterPicks.

            <p>
                With a potential survivor championship on the line, Alec dropped multiple players in order to hoard every possible TE for MNF to try to help Josh K beat Josh L. Josh L had Dalton Kincaid at TE who was ruled out 90 min before kickoff of MNF. Matt Smith picked Josh L in survivor, and Alec's pick Trevor had already lost. This was a last ditch attempt from Alec to try to get Matt Smith to also lose so that survivor could continue on another week. There was some discussion about whether or not this is collusion, but survivor throws an interesting wrinkle into the discussion.
            </p>
            <LeagueQuote>
                "Follow the money"<br />- Josh Kraines
            </LeagueQuote>
            <p>
                Because Alec had money riding on survivor, it was in his best interest to help Josh K beat Josh L. Let's examine the collusion section of the league bylaws for more details:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Collusion occurs when two teams work together against the rest of the league, or one team makes moves to benefit another team without trying to improve its own position. Collusion undermines the ethic of good sportsmanship as well as the competitive balance of the league. Examples include: one-sided trades; dropping a player so that another team may pick up that player; transactions that involve future considerations or preferential treatment; and swapping players to cover bye weeks or injury.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This is arguably collusion based on this definition, but the case isn't cut and dry. Alec did make moves that benefit another team, but you could argue that they were trying to improve their own position by doing so. Their position in this case just happened to be in survivor and not in the league itself. Whether or not this would hold up in the league court is unknown, but it ultimately didn't work and ended up costing Alec $11 FAAB to pick up Kyle Pitts, who he dropped to do this in the first place. Kyle Pitts was not bid on by any other league member, so this $11 FAAB and public shaming can be considered punishment for Alec's potential collusion that didn't work anyway.

                While follow eyes the steady kneel, the game grim and daring:<br /><br />
                But O heart! heart! heart!<br /><br />
                O the bleeding drops of red,<br /><br />
                Where on the bench my Tight End lies,<br /><br />
                Fallen cold and dead."<br />- Anonymous League Manager

                This poem is a nod to O Captain, My Captain by Walt Whitman. Our anonymous league poet has outdone themselves this week. Chief Correspondent ChatGPT is back from their hiatus and wrote an analysis on this poem for our readers this week:
            </p>
            <p>
                This parody of Walt Whitman's "O Captain! My Captain!" draws from the original's mourning of Abraham Lincoln's assassination, using victory marred by tragedy. However, the metaphor has some flaws: tight ends don't "weather" sacks—that's a quarterback's domain, not a TE's. The "steady kneel" line is also puzzling, perhaps meant as a nod to end-of-game rituals, but it feels forced and disrupts the rhythm. That said, the poem effectively captures the bittersweet sting of fantasy football injuries, shifting from triumph to grief. A solid effort from the anonymous poet, though a bit more football savvy would elevate it to true literary heights.
