                Week 3 brought us our first perfect manager of the season, one of the biggest upsets in league history, and a new best loser of the season. It will also be tough for anyone to top 32 points put up by MIN DEF for the rest of the season.

            <p>
                We finally had our first perfect manager this week. Super Ja'Marrio Bros. achieved 100% efficiency, leaving zero points on their bench. On the flip side, Deep Shot to Kirk was our least skilled manager, only getting 67.9% of their possible points. They left 34.76 points on the bench, which would have been more than enough to win their matchup.

            <p>
                D.K. Lost a Minion continued their perfect start to the season with a victory over WalterPickens in MotW. They were led by Jonathan Taylor's 32.8 points and got solid contributions from Jordan Mason and the IND DEF. This win keeps them as one of only two 3-0 teams in the league, and extends their MotW winning streak to 4 games dating back to last season.
            </p>
            <p>
                WalterPickens had a decent week with 113.64 points but couldn't keep up with D.K. Lost a Minion's explosion. They got good games from Christian McCaffrey and Will Reichard, but their quarterback situation continues to be a problem. This loss drops them to 1-2 and puts them in danger of falling out of playoff contention.

            <p>
                BBCU continued their dominant start to the season with a narrow victory over Lord of the Littles. They were led by their defense and got solid contributions from Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Trey McBride. This undeserved win makes them one of only two 3-0 teams in the league.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord of the Littles had a strong showing with 131.4 points but started an injured QB so they gave the game away for free. They got excellent games from Garrett Wilson and Cam Skattebo, but their boneheaded mistake made none of that matter. This loss drops them to 2-1 but they remain in good position in the standings despite their blunder.

                Bye Week Curious scored less than 73 points each of the first two weeks, but the A.J. Brown revenge game put them over the hump this week and they put up a whopping 85.92 points. Those 22.9 points from A.J. Brown were the most that this team has had from any player this season, and they were somehow the MVP of the week, scoring an embarrassing 26.7% of this team's points this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep Shot to Kirk had their worst week of the season with only 73.56 points. They would've beaten Bye Week Curious in either week 1 or week 2 with this score, but it wasn't enough in week 3. This cost everyone to lose in survivor this week, since nobody thought that Bye Week Curious could win a game with this lineup. If they hadn't traded A.J. Brown to Bye Week Curious, they very likely would've won this matchup.

                Costo Guys finally broke through with their first win of the season, defeating Singing Like Mariah Terry handily. They were led by Lamar Jackson, Jahmyr Gibbs, and Jake Ferguson. This win keeps them from falling to 0-3 and gives them hope for the rest of the season. Their WR room is awful, and they continue to play the Ravens defense every week despite them going negative twice now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Singing Like Mariah Terry had a disappointing week with only 88.76 points, leaving 38.3 points on their bench. This was their first week being let down by Patrick Mahomes, and everyone else continued to disappoint them as well as they have in previous weeks. Ricky Pearsall was the only bright spot this week with nearly 20 points.

            <p>
                First Down Syndrome absolutely crushed, scoring 145.64 points which was the second highest score of any team this season. They were led by Jalen Hurts and Mark Andrews, with solid contributions from Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins as well. This win did not go unnoticed, and they had the top QB and TE of the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luck of the Dog had a decent week with 125.12 points, but it wasn't nearly enough to compete with First Down Syndrome. They got good games from Josh Allen, Kenneth Walker, and Keenan Allen, but Derrick Henry and Kyle Pitts let them down. This loss drops them to 1-2 but they remain in the 6th spot in the standings thanks to their strong PF.

            <p>
                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. had their best week of the season with a victory over The Barkley Brawlers. They were led by Courtland Sutton, Kyren Williams, and SEA DEF. Their only disappointments were Ja'Marr Chase, Sam LaPorta, and Brandon Aubrey, who all scored less than 10 points. They got the win despite that, which moves them to 2-1.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barkley Brawlers had a disappointing week with only 98.28 points. They are rostering 3 QBs and 3 TEs and still can't manage to get more than 13 points from either position. Their WR didn't do great either, and Saquon scoring less than 10 points makes it really hard for them to win a game. If their kicker and defense didn't put up double digits, this could've been one of the worst performances of the season.

Deep Shot to Kirk has some of the lowest points against in the league, but sits at 1-2 in 10th place due to their PF being below 300.

Glizzy Gobblers and Singing Like Mariah Terry have had the toughest schedules this season, and are at 1-2 and 0-3 respectively, but rank much better in the Power Rankings thanks to their strong performances in their losses.

Deep Shot to Kirk has the next highest playoff odds at 80% despite being 1-2 and in 10th place. Remember these playoff odds are based on future projections, and they have Rashee Rice waiting to cook everyone starting in week 7. WalterPicks really doesn't believe in Costo Guys, WalterPickens, or Singing Like Mariah Terry, all below 30% to make the playoffs. Bye Week Curious remains at 1% playoff odds despite getting their first win this week.

Lord of the Littles is 2 weeks away from their first every MotW appearance, they'd need a BBCU win and then a Deep Shot to Kirk win in week 5 to get put into it.

            <p>
                Lord of the Littles lost by 4.9 points to BBCU with an out QB. This type of mistake allowing another team to start out 3-0 is so tough to see for any manager that is competing for the championship, not just trying to avoid last place. Being a top seed is so important to get the bye week, and every win matters along the way. Allowing someone to win because you didn't set your lineup in week 3 could alter the course of the entire season. Maybe you'd be the one with 95% playoffs odds instead of them.

                Funny to write this one up about the reigning champion of the league. See that little gold medal in Sleeper? Who has that? Oh right, Trevor does. Scoreboard.

                Anthony clearly throwing some shade at Josh Little for starting a QB who was out this week. Weird to throw shade at someone who let you get a free win, but agree with the sentiment as someone who didn't directly benefit from this action (or lack thereof).
