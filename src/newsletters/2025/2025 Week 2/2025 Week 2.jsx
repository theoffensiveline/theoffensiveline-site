                Things are starting to take shape in week 2. Players are building on past performances, we're getting more data on which teams are good and which teams are bad, and we're leaving tons of points on the bench collectively for the 2nd straight week. We had a new high score, another low score by Bye Week Curious, and the closest matchup in league history decided by only 0.04 points. This is mathematically the closest a game can be without tying, given that a passing yard is worth 0.04 points.

            <ArticleCaption>Weekly Manager Skill Assessment</ArticleCaption>
            <p>
                There were no perfect managers again this week, and our least skilled manager was The Barkley Brawlers who only managed to get 65.4% of their total possible points. They could've been the top team this week if they optimized their lineup. Bye Week Curious could've gotten 100% of his possible points and still would've lost to anyone's unoptimized lineup from this week. The most skilled manager this week was the winner in MotW, D.K's Minions Return?, who managed well when it mattered most.

            <p>
                D.K's Minions Return continued their win streak in MotW, defeating Glizzy Gobblers handily and handing out 5 dogs in the process. They had this weeks #1 QB and #1 RB in Drake Maye and Jonathan Taylor, and got decent points from almost everyone else as well. Omarion Hampton let them down again this week after being a very unpopular 3rd round "reach" pick amongst the league managers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glizzy Gobblers will be gobbling 5 glizzies this week after being let down by Derrick Henry, DeVonta Smith, Kyle Pitts, Jake Bates, and DAL DEF who narrowly avoided a 6th dog with just 1 point. They are lucky that the J Williams' popped off, and Mike Evans was able to eek out more than 10 points this week. These 5 glizzies actually bring down their average glizzies per MotW loss to 5.2 glizzies.

            <p>
                BBCU cruised to an easy victory this week, making any and all lineup decisions they had to make irrelevant to the outcome of the game. They made mostly the right decisions, and scored the 4th most points of any team this week. They got double digits from all but 2 players, leading them to this free win.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bye Week Curious had the opposite week this week, having only one player break double digits. It is going to be tough to win games when Tyrone Tracy is your second highest scoring player. This team is 0-2 and is off to maybe the worst start in league history. Everyone is routinely betting against them in survivor, but we will see if they can turn the tide and ruin a lot of hopes in that pool.
            </p>
            <MatchupPlot data={starterData} matchupId={1} />
            <p>
                BBCU plays against Lord of the Littles in week 3, a matchup between 2 of the league's 3 undefeated teams. One team will emerge 3-0 and be in a great spot to avoid last place. Bye Week Curious plays against Burrowing in McAnus in week 3, where they hope to create an upset in a lopsided matchup.

            <p>
                As stated previously, this is the narrowest possible margin of victory without tying, and sadly for Costo Guys, they ended up one the wrong side of the history books. They are now 0-2 and were so close to being 0-1-1 or 1-1. If only Lamar Jackson had 226 passing yards instead of 225 and we would've had the first tie in league history. This publication is very glad that was not the case, since it would've broken everything. Evan Engram and Marvin Harrison Jr. seemed to be the difference this week, and BTJ didn't help either.
            </p>
            <p>
                First Down Syndrome must feel pretty good winning by 0.04 points in week 2 and avoiding an 0-2 start to the season because of it. Amon-Ra St. Brown absolutely crushed this week, scoring nearly 34% of this team's points. That will stand as one of the best MVP performances of the season, and couldn't have come in a better matchup.

            <ArticleSubheader>Heavy WR Draft Strategy Paid Off</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                In this Hubbell Division matchup, Burrowing in McAnus had two huge games from his WR this week, with Malik Nabers 37.7 points leading the way. Nabers performance was overshadowed by Amon-Ra in terms of awards this week, but he helped lead this team to victory without a doubt. Davante Adams also popped for more than 20 points, and Harold Fannin outscored Brock Bowers, making WalterPickens regret their entire draft.
            </p>
            <p>
                WalterPickens got another great game from CMC, but was let down by Justin Fields who struggled mightily against the Bills defense while Dak Prescott put up over 22 points on his bench against the Giants. These 22 points wouldn't have been enough on their own, but starting Dobbins over Henderson as well would've been enough to win. This manager needs to figure their shit out if they want to repeat as back-to-back champions.

                Burrowing in McAnus will play against Bye Week Curious in week 3 in a highly anticipated matchup. WalterPickens begins his 3 week road trip through the Glizzy Division, starting fittingly with a MotW matchup against D.K's Minions Return? in week 3. They will be hoping to go on a hot streak and rain glizzies all over the Glizzy Division over the next 3 weeks.

            <p>
                Lord of the Littles is off to a 2-0 start this season, with Puka Nacua and De'Von Achane leading the way for them in week 2. It is nice when your high draft picks return on the cost, and this week was a great example of that. They didn't get much help from others, but got enough to win their matchup which is all that matters. They were our worst winner this week, but a winner is a winner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barkley Brawlers were aptly lead by their RBs this week with James Cook and Saquon Barkley scoring in numbers.  Their main issues this week came from QB, WR, and DEF. This team will have to find the best QB to start on a weekly basis, but they certainly are not short on options. It is tough to lose to a divisional opponent though, especially when you left so many points on your bench.

                Losing is Terry finally renamed their team this week, but that didn't help them win their matchup in week 2. They didn't get enough points from anyone besides Patrick Mahomes, who has been shockingly good for fantasy to start the season. However, just like the Chiefs, the commish is 0-2 after 2 games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. only got 4.6 points from Ja'Marr Chase last week, but they got their money's worth this week with Chase going off for 36.5 points in week 2. They also got 24.5 points from their kicker this week, which might be a new league record, but we have been unable to confirm that at this time. They avoid the 0-2 start, and sent the commish packing.

BBCU has the highest WalterPicks playoff odds of any team at 90%, followed closely by D.K's Minions Return? at 82% and Burrowing in McAnus at 80%. Bye Week Curious in last place has only 3% chance of making the playoffs, while fellow 0-2 team Losing is Terry has over 50% chance according to WalterPicks.
