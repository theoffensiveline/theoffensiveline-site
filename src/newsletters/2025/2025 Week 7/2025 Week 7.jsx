                This week had the chance to be an all-timer, but many inefficient managers kept us from an insane number of fantasy points. Our most efficient teams barely hit 90% efficiency this week, and we had multiple managers in the 60s and 70s. If all managers managed better, this could've been an extremely high scoring week. That didn't stop BBCU from topping the record they set themselves last week for #1 score of the season. They did this on only 86% efficiency, and of course they did this against Tragedy of an Unlucky Man, who continues to have the hardest schedule, maybe ever. Luck is not their only problem though, skill is also an issue. They left 46.5 points on their bench this week, which is the 3rd most this season of any team.

            <p>
                This might be one of the worst managed weeks of all time in this league. Our top manager was at 91.9% and our bottom manager was at 70.4%. This 70.4% was largely driven by the best bench player of the season, Bo Nix, who scored 39.96 fantasy points. This start/sit decision cost The Barkley Brawlers a close matchup. Uncle Rico Went Pro was also very inefficient at just 71.6%, but they won their close matchup against First Down Syndrome who had a much lower ceiling.

                BBCU defeated a Glizzy Division member for the 2nd straight week, this time handing out 5 glizzies to Tragedy of an Unlucky Man. This win was another easy one. This week they needed 4 players to win though, compared to the 3 they needed last week. All the same faces made the cut this week, with Herbert, Bijan, JSN and McBride leading the charge and totaling 104.8 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tragedy of an Unlucky Man struggled this week, but it was partially their own doing. They left a lot of points, and saved dogs, on their bench including Kyle Pitts with 13.2 points and DeVonta Smith with 33.3 points. Mike Evans and Darren Waller both put up 0 points, so all those points could've directly contributed to their total instead. Sam Darnold, Kenneth Walker, and Jake Bates contributed the last 3 dogs for this manager.

BBCU earns their 6th MotW victory of all time, moving up to a tie for 3rd with Singing Like Mariah Terry. Tragedy of an Unlucky Man took this opportunity to grow their lead, earning their 10th loss and is up to 52 hotdogs/shots consumed, both the most of any manager by far.

            <p>
                Bye Week Curious put up a sad 88.22 points this week, but this is actually their 4th highest score through 7 weeks. They didn't even have any players on bye this week, although you might think that seeing Tyler Allgeier starting at RB for them. They left Rhamondre Stevenson against the Titans on their bench, but ultimately their start/sit decisions did not matter, since they wouldn't have had enough points to beat Costco Guys even at 100% efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costco Guys put up nearly 130 points this week and was led by Jahmyr Gibbs with 36.8 points. Stafford chipped in 27.38 points and Jake Ferguson had 21.9 points as well. They had disappointments from all of their WRs, but it did not matter since they were easily able to get the W this week.

            <MatchupPlot data={starterData} matchupId={2} />

                Bye Week Curious will be up against fellow 2-5 team Singing Like Mariah Terry in week 8, but this time they will have to worry about bye weeks from Ashton Jeanty and Kyler Murray. This matchup will be important in the race for last place. Costco Guys will be up against 4-3 WalterPickens, but will be without a number of players including Stafford, Gibbs, Marv, and BTJ. Lamar Jackson may miss this week as well due to injury, so they've got an uphill battle in this one.

            <p>
                D.K's Dying Minions don't seem to be dying anymore. CeeDee Lamb returned this week and put up 22 points in his return. Jonathan Taylor and Drake Maye continued to put this team on their back again this week with stellar performances. They got some help from Tyler Warren as well who had a great game. This team is on a roll and looks like the team to beat this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Singing Like Mariah Terry on the other hand, struggled again this week. Patrick Mahomes continues to be the main bright spot on this team, but he cannot do enough by himself to get these wins. He needs more help from Justin Jefferson and their RBs. Mason Taylor only had 6.1 points, which was not super helpful either.

            <p>
                Lord of the Littles did not have a good week, partially due to their own mismanagement. They played an injured Puka Nacua in their flex spot on London time this week. They didn't have much better options on their bench, but this is still some blatant mismanagement. Their kicker and team mascot Cam Little also put up 0 points, but he was not injured, just bad. He has since been cut from the squad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. was once again narrowly behind the top team of the week, sneaking under the radar as a very scary team to face off with. The weekly ceiling for this team is extremely high, especially when Ja'Marr Chase gets 23 targets in a game. If Baker Mayfield had one of his typical games, this team easily would've had the highest week of the season this week.

                First Down Syndrome didn't have a great week by any measure, but it was pretty middle of the road. They had a chance to win on MNF, but Nico Collins let them down with just 6.7 points (6 7). Their defense struggled in the Unc Bowl and ended up with -1 point, so a different defensive selection could've made all the difference in this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uncle Rico Went Pro had 4 massive performances that helped them secure this victory, with 2 criminals leading the way. Rashee Rice was excellent in his return from suspenion, scoring 23.2 points on a limited number of snaps, scoring his points as quickly as he could. Quinshon Judkins also put in 26.4 points this week and beat up on a weak Miami defense. NE Defense and Davante Adams were the other two boomers this week.

            <p>
                The Barkley Brawlers had this game in the bag for most of the week, as their early players exceeded expectations while their opponents players struggled. Chris Olave and Tucker Kraft did their job, scoring 26.8 and 16.8 points respectively. The rest of their team struggled this week, so they didn't even end up cracking 100 points. Bo Nix was resting on their bench with nearly 40 points, which is one struggle of rostering multiple QBs.
            </p>
            <p>
                WalterPickens was in a rough spot until Sunday Night Football, where CMC put on a masterclass. In his first game with George Kittle back, he was able to rack up over 100 yards rushing and still had his normal WR stat line of 7 catches for 72 yards too. All of that came along with 2 TDs, for a total of 39.1 points, the most of any RB this season. This gave WalterPickens a 20 point lead going into MNF, where it was Jared Goff vs Cade Otton + 20 points, and Otton ended up outscoring Goff straight up thanks to Gibbs monster game on the ground.

The bottom of the leaderboard saw no change, with Bye Week Curious and Tragedy of an Unlucky Man remaining in the last 2 spots.

Bye Week Curious has over 50% chance to get last in the simulations, Tragedy of an Unlucky Man would have to win a game to make this happen. The top 4 teams are clearly a class above the rest, all with over 95% chance to make the playoffs in both simulations.

            <ArticleSubheader>Shots or Dogs?</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                The league had an interesting debate after Greg did 7 shots at once for his MotW video; what is the number of shots/dogs where you choose to do one over the other? The Offensive Line did not do enough investigative reporting on this, but will have results in next week's edition summarizing the thoughts of the league. Anecdotally, some managers said more than 2 hotdogs is too many, where others would prefer to eat hotdogs if it gets above 4. Alec even mentioned that he could eat 10 hotdogs in one sitting, which Anthony doubted heavily. Alec may one day have to eat 10 hotdogs given his luck in MotW historically.

                Anthony beat the snot out of Alec this week, and doesn't even care enough to get his name right. Alec has had the toughest schedule in the league this season, and is in prime position to do his 3rd punishment because of it.

                Another banger from the anonymous league poet, this time in reference to Alec and his MotW woes. May the random schedule always be going through the Glizzy Division.
