                Week 8 came with a lot of notable outcomes, including 5 #1 performances. We got a new high score for the season, 191.58 points from The Barkley Brawlers, which is the 2nd highest score in the PPR era of this league and the 3rd highest of all time. This is the highest score in MotW in league history. The Offensive Line will be building out more historical data on the site this off-season. This 191.58 point performance also unsurprisingly led to the biggest blowout of the season, with a 84.9 point margin in MotW. Our other #1 performances were Uncle Rico Went Pro with the best loss of the season at 139.72 points, 3 perfect managers, and the Tighest End Tucker Kraft with 33.3 points.

                After one of the worst managed weeks of all time, we followed it up with one of the best managed weeks of all time. Bye weeks certainly help eliminate bad choices, but not all managers had benches full of bye weeks. WalterPickens was the worst manager this week with just 75% efficiency, losing to Costco Guys who had 100% efficiency on a much lower potential point total due to byes.

            <p>
                BBCU got pulverized in this matchup. They never stood a chance with their opponent putting up 191.58 points, but their players didn't even try to help them avoid shots/dogs either. The only major surprise player that went below 10 points was Bijan Robinson, who had an easy matchup with the Dolphins but only got 9 carries and 3 targets in the the blowout loss. This was his first game under 16 points this season. Better days ahead for this team, but 5 shots/dogs is tough.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barkley Brawlers had one of the best games in league history thanks to 3 players total over 100 points, and 5 more players in double figures. James Cook, Saquon Barkley and Tucker Kraft each had between 33.3 and 33.6 points. Their lowest scorer was their defense with 7 points. This team got a statement win in MotW.

                One and six will need yet another name change after this week after their hard-fought victory over Uncle Rico Went Pro. This was an extremely well-rounded performance from their squad, with their lowest scorer having 8.4 points, and their other 8 players scoring between 13.4 and 23.22 points. They didn't get an easy matchup again this week, but they were actually able to overcome it for once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uncle Rico Went Pro put up a fight in this loss, becoming the best loser of the season so far, fittingly against One and six who can continue to claim the title of toughest schedule going. Uncle Rico Went Pro had big WR numbers from Rashee Rice and Troy Franklin, but their RBs didn't do enough to help them get over the hump.

The loser of this will be in firm possession of last place with only a few weeks left to course correct. Uncle Rico Went Pro will be going into a Hubbell Division matchup with Super Ja'Marrio Bros. where they will rely on the Hubbell Curse to get the win.

                D.K's Dying Minions don't seem to be dying anymore for the 2nd straight week. This team desperately needs a name change, sitting at 7-1 firmly in first place and putting up huge numbers every week. It was the usual suspects for them, Drake Maye and Jonathan Taylor, and TB DEF kicked in 26 points just to rub it in their opponents face.

                Super Ja'Marrio Bros. had an awful game, with Ja'Marr Chase's 21.1 points the only bright spot on this team. Newly acquired Woody Marks also put up 15.1 points, but the rest of their team was under 12 points with many all of their non-RB/WR players scoring 6 or less points.

                Bye Week Curious made it really easy for their opponent to get the win this week, putting up less than 80 points for the 3rd time this season. They are responsible for 3 of the 4 lowest scoring weeks of the season among all teams. Daniel Jones and Daniel Goedert made this performance not look absolutely awful.

                Singing Like Mariah Terry had one of their only easy matchups of the season this week, luckily for them since they barely broke 100 points. Patrick Mahomes continues to be their best player, playing with a chip on his shoulder ever since they didn't want to draft him. Ka'imi Fairbairn was their 2nd highest scorer, followed by Mason Taylor and Justin Jefferson.

                First Down Syndrome again didn't have a great week by any measure, but it was enough to get the win this time. Breece Hall had his best game of the season in the Jets first win, and he created a QB controversy between him and Justin Fields in the process. Chris Boswell knocked in 22 points to help this team get the W.

                Lord of the Littles might be cursed after dropping Cam Little, scoring just 90.12 points this week in their first game without their team mascot. Achane and Odunze continued to put up numbers, but the loss of Skattebo will hurt this team's RB output for the rest of the season. They will rely more heavily on their WRs to fill in the flex spot in their hunt for the playoffs.

                Costco Guys looked like a longshot to win coming into MNF. They had less than 70 points, and Sleeper gave them less than 30% chance to win. They had Marcus Mariota, Kareem Hunt, and KC DEF left to play. With Mariota and KC DEF somewhat cancelling out, it was up to Kareem Hunt to be the difference maker, and he did just that with 2 TDs sealing the win for this team.

            <p>
                WalterPickens experienced the first CMC dud of the season against a stout HOU DEF. This was McCaffrey's first game under 22.5 points this season. They also started ATL DEF this week against the Dolphins, which seemed like a lock for 5+ points. Somehow the Dolphins scored 34 points against the Falcons, who only managed 1 sack on Tua, to net 0 points. These 2 performances, along with a disappointing week from Lucian, cost this team a win and leaves them just 8.06 points ahead of the 7 seed.

With divisional matchups each of the last 3 weeks, the MotW will be trapped. If D.K's Dying Minions wins this week, the Hubbell Division will be safe from MotW for the rest of the season. If they lose, the Glizzy Division will be safe from MotW for the rest of the season. The Avon Division is at risk of being stuck with MotW in either case.

            <ArticleSubheader>Alec Cheating The MotW System?</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                Alec had to do a 5 shot/dog punishment this week from his MotW loss. He sent the league a video of him failing to eat 5 hotdogs in one sitting, after boldly claiming he could eat 10 hot dogs if he needed to. His claim was that he "wasn't hungry", but to him 5 hotdogs should be nothing, since he said "I think I could eat 10 hotdogs in one go" just 2 weeks ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alec followed this failed attempt with a video of him doing "5 shots", which the group had multiple qualms with. The first issue is that the alcohol of choice was only 27% ABV, hardly making these 5 shots 5 alcoholic drinks. The second issue is that Alec poured about 20% of each shot on the table instead of into the glass, making this more like 4 shots instead of 5. Alec's nice jacket could not distract the group from his complete lack of integrity.
            </p>
            <ArticleSubheader>Shots or Dogs?</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                Last week the group had a discussion about whether you would choose shots or dogs based on the number you had to do for MotW. This week we have multiple data points based on a league-wide survey and historical data in the post-hotdog era to settle this debate once and for all. This poll had 11 respondents, and we have had 11 participants in MotW history, which makes sense. Here are the results:
            </p>
            <SurveyStackedBarChart surveyData={surveyData.surveyData} />
            <ArticleCaption>Survey results show preferences for shots vs. hot dogs based on quantity. Historical data shows actual choices made in MotW.</ArticleCaption>
            <p>
                It was interesting to see the group's opinion get more narrow as the numbers got larger. Most people did not have a preference if the number was 4 or fewer, but as the number increased, people have a clear preference between shots and dogs, with only 1 person claiming they would do either shots or dogs at 6 or more. This person claimed either for every single value of shots/dogs. Two other interesting submissions: One that would prefer hot dogs for 1-7, but shots for 8+, and someone else that would prefer shots for 1-7 and hot dogs for 8+. These opinions basically cancelled each other out, but are very interesting polar opposites in this survey.

                This survey matched reality relatively closely. About 40% of people preferred hot dogs when the total is &lt;= 3, and many of the either group lean towards shots in reality to fill out the other 60%. For 4 shots/dogs the either group is a little more split in reality. For 5 shots/dogs this is where we see a difference in survey vs. reality. More people who have had to do 5 opt for dogs than the survey showed. This could be due to small sample size of 5 shot/dog MotW punishments, but 7/9 people who have had to do this chose hotdogs. For &gt;= 6 shots/dogs, the majority of the survey said hotdogs, but the majority of reality has chosen to do shots. This is definitely personal bias due to limited sample size, with only 7 data points. I broke it down by 6+ here because the survey results were the same for 6, 7, and 8+, but our actual results for 7 and 8 have all been shots historically, so it will be interesting to see if anyone ever eats 7+ hotdogs.

                A little crazy to say after your 2nd win out of 8 games, especially when you have to play the other 2-win team this week, but go off king.

                Alec getting hyped up in the chat is rare, especially given the name of the chat.

                A question to ponder on this merry week.<br />
                Why call it Football when we don't use out feet?<br />
                <br />
                Handball's been claimed so that's not an option.<br />
                But Football is too, yet it made adoption.<br />
                <br />
                What a weird name, who really cares the name choice.<br />
                All we want is some touchdowns and to watch them rejoice.<br />

                Chief Correspondent ChatGPT weighs in on another anonymous poem:
            </p>
            <p>
                This poem charmingly captures a common curiosity about American football's name through accessible rhyming couplets and a conversational tone that feels genuinely playful. However, the meter stumbles awkwardly, particularly in the middle lines, and the poem ultimately abandons its own question with a shrug—"who really cares"—before pivoting to touchdowns, which feels less like clever resolution and more like giving up on an actually interesting linguistic puzzle it set out to explore.
