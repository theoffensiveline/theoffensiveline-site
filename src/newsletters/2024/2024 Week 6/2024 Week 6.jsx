            <p>
                Week 6 was pretty crazy, with some impressive performances on both ends of the spectrum. The 2 highest scoring teams of the week faced off, and Twin Bowers was able to put up the #3 highest score of the season in that game to win it. Giving Me a Chubb was the runner up in that game, and was the 2nd best loser of the season as well. Youngster Joey managed to score the 4th lowest score of the season this week, and proceeded to get fleeced in a trade they proposed. You will notice there are more awards than normal, with 2 "Biggest D" awards getting shared this week, and 2 perfect managers. All of the position awards will now have multiple recipients if there is ever a tie. I'm surprised it took 6 weeks to have a tie in these awards.

            <p>
                As sort of mentioned above, there were 2 perfect managers this week, Pink Pony Kupp and Costo Guys. Pink Pony Kupp got the award, which is fitting because they were the better manager of the two this week, scoring more points than Costo Guys. Costo Guys also cheesed their way to this 100% this week, by having all injured or BYE players on their bench. The lowest percentage this week was an awful 69.8% from Crashee Rice. This was the 7th most points left on a bench this season.

            <p>
                Poor Management came into this week with one goal; to be the first manager to have a 0-shot/dog loss in MotW. If Mike Evans didn't get injured, they would've likely had one less shot/dog to worry about. GB came really close to that 10 point threshold, and the Cowboys got absolutely murdered which somehow meant Ferguson did nothing. We've yet to see a 0-shot/dog loss in MotW, but maybe we will someday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp was feeling the pressure this week, after they bet on themselves in the survivor pool. Their team showed up to play, and 4 of their players got over 18 points. Bucky Irving put up big numbers with Rachaad White out, and David Montgomery scored a TD as he always does. Tank Dell also shined without Nico Collins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trevor selected himself in the survivor pool, and stayed alive by doing so. No managers selected Poor Management to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                This matchup between two Matt's was a close one, and the victorious Matt was carried by Chris Godwin. Godwin was the MVP this week, scoring a whopping 28.13% of this team's points, #2 on the season. These 35.5 points were also the #2 WR performance of the season in our league. Kamara, Aubrey, and London also did their parts, as they have done all season for this team.
            </p>
            <p>
                First Down Syndrome had standout games from Kittle and Hurts, but was ultimately let down by Tyler Bass on Monday Night. Tyler Bass missing a FG and an XP cost this team the game this week. Rome Odunze and Jaleel McLaughlin were also disappointing, but Tyler Bass hurt the most. The Bills signed a kicker to their practice squad this week, indicating that Bass' time in Buffalo could be up soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two managers correctly selected Kirk Thuggins & The Boys to win in the survivor pool. Jake and Alec barely stayed alive with that pick. No managers selected First Down Syndrome to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                Crashee Rice had -0.1 points between their two RBs this week. Travis Etienne ended up with -0.1 points because he went out after getting injured, and James Cook put up a 0 after he was a surprise inactive on Monday Night Football. Cole Kmet and Jayden Daniels were the only truly impressive players on the team this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 was able to get big games from Josh Allen and Bijan Robinson, and non-0 games from all of their other players, which was enough to beat their opponent this week. DJ Moore was disappointing, thanks to the big game from Cole Kmet, but that didn't end up making a difference in this matchup.

            <p>
                Hot Dog Enjoyer was able to get their 2nd win of the season this week, thanks to 4 big performances from Brock Purdy, Joe Mixon, Terry McLaurin and HOU DEF. CeeDee Lamb did his part as well. This team is now in a 5-way tie for last, which is better than where they were last week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calvin's Cold Streak got 0.9 points from Calvin Ridley this week, and only had Najee Harris above 20 points. This wasn't a terrible performance from them, but they ultimately fell short in this matchup. They did leave some points on their bench that could've helped them win, which is always frustrating.

            <p>
                Twin Bowers was able to secure the victory in this one, thanks to a well rounded team performance. 4 players scored over 21 pints for them, and 3 more had 14 or more. Their K and DEF each had 6, which isn't great but isn't bad. This was a dominant performance and was the 3rd most points by a team this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Giving Me a Chubb had a chance to win this matchup, as they left Jakobi Meyers in their starting lineup while being out in their game. We've got autosub for a reason, and they elected not to use it. They left a lot of points on the bench, and had the highest potential score in the league. Derrick Henry was a beast again, and Caleb Williams had a breakout game. This team is still rolling despite the loss, as they had the 2nd most points by a team this week.

                Youngster Joey did not put up a fight in this game, only scoring 85.16 points, the 4th lowest point total of any team this season. Marvin Harrison put up a big fat donut after getting concussed, and Saquon had a disappointing 7.4 points. If Courtland Sutton is your 2nd highest scoring player, you probably lost that week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costo Guys (still don't understand Costo) cruised to an easy win in this one. Breece Hall, Lamar, Diontae Johnson, and Chris Boswell put up numbers this week, and Ray-Ray McCloud and Alec Pierce did not. Not much else to say about this one since this matchup was not close.

The 5-way tie for 1st is interesting to note, still anyone's game for first or last place.

                Giving Me a Chubb reclaims the #1 spot in the power rankings this week after their loss. This seems to be a trend this season of moving up after losing your matchup.

The easiest schedules by this measure are Costo Guys and Just Joshin pt. 2, closely followed by Crashee Rice and Hot Dog Enjoyer. Twin Bowers has had a very hard schedule so far.

                The league saw many trades happen this week, some were better than others. Many clown emojis were reacted in the Sleeper chat. Memes were made, and managers were clowned on. Allen Lazard got passed around countless times, literally sold for FAAB dollars on the open market.

                It appears some managers don't even know what FAAB is or how Lazard was traded for such currency. This league can be illiterate at times, which is ironic with how much written content is made available to them every week. There is a meme about just how illiterate this league can be in the meme section.
