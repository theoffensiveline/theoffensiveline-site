            <p>
                Week 15 was the first round of the playoffs and the toilet bowl, and 4 teams were sitting on the sidelines watching the madness take place. We had our #1 Best Managed Team of the season this week from Costo Guys who scored 192.3 points in the first round of the playoffs. Maybe they lost all those games because they knew they didn't wanna waste this week during a playoff bye. This #1 performance also led to the #1 Deadest Horse of the season, and they were so close to defeating Giving Me a Chubb by 100 points. Costo Guys had the top scoring RB, WR, and DEF this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had the 4th lowest score of the season from Youngster Joey, who only scored 76.96 points in their playoff loss. This isn't their lowest score this season, they scored 64.26 points just last week. This is the lowest score of any playoff team in recorded league history. There wasn't one player on their team who scored at least 12 points this week. This team really made the playoffs? They would've lost to any toilet bowl team this week.

            <p>
                Costo Guys put up the most points this week, but wasn't the most efficient. That award went to Kirk Thuggins & The Boys, who scored 99.5% of their maximum and only left 0.8 points on their bench this week. The least efficient manager was Fortnite Master Builder, but they were still able to pull out the win so they're fine with that.

            <p>
                In the final MotW of the season, Fortnite Master Builder was able to secure the victory, just like they were able to do in the toilet bowl last season. They will start next season with MotW the same way they started this season with MotW. If the theory holds about how Sleeper creates schedules, and we don't make any changes, we could see a rematch between Fortnite Master Builder and League Loser Prophecy in the first MotW of next season. Fortnite Master Builder was able to get this win thanks in large part to Mike Evans dropping 36.9 points. He was 0.4 points away from being the Widest Receiver this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Njorkin da Tenis had a good run in MotW for being last in PF this season. This team knows how to put up points under duress. Sadly this week, they couldn't get it done in the toilet bowl, and will be advancing to the semi-finals of the toilet bowl. Rhamondre Stevenson, Kyle Pitts, Daniel Carlson, and ARI DEF all scored below 10 points, so 4 shots/dogs are in order.

            <p>
                Two teams that were in the playoffs last year found themselves in the toilet bowl this year, and this matchup was electric. Twin Bowers schedule difficulty carried into the toilet bowl, playing against the 2nd highest scoring team of the week while scoring the 3rd most points. This was a week for the Brown's, with both A.J. and Chase scoring over 25 points for this team. DEN DEF also chipped in 20 points, but it wasn't enough. An atypical rough game from Brock Bowers was likely the difference maker in this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kirk Thuggins & The Boys was able to win this matchup thanks to a well rounded team performance, with only their defense scoring less that 10 points. The standout was Baker Mayfield, who scored 28.02 points this week while feeding Mike Evans. Jerry Jeudy and Keenan Allen both scored over 20 points as well to help this team win.

                Youngster Joey scored the 4th least points of any team this season this week in their first playoff appearance. Their top scorer was Brian Robinson, who scored 11.7 points this week. They had 3 other players above 10 points, and 5 players who scored less than 10 points, including their first and second round picks, Saquon Barkley and Marvin Harrison Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calvin's Cold Streak essentially had a playoff bye in round 1, but that didn't stop them from putting up points. Jared Goff had 41.06 points this week in a shootout with the Bills, and this was the 5th best MVP performance of the season, scoring 32.29% of the team total. Other top contributors were Josh Jacobs and Ja'Marr Chase.

            <p>
                If we don't count the Damar Hamlin game, this might be the biggest blowout in league history. Costo Guys won this matchup by nearly 100 points. They had 2 players score over 35 points, and 5 players who scored 22 or more points. Impressive stuff, hopefully they didn't blow their full load in round 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Giving Me a Chubb couldn't hit triple digit points in the playoffs, but gets to hide this poor performance behind Youngster Joey's awful performance. Their top scorer was Trey McBride who scored 17.7 points, and they got a 0 from Amari Cooper while the Bills offense otherwise went crazy this week. They didn't really have a chance to win this, but would've liked to have put up more of a fight.

Ja'Marr Chase and Jordan Addison went nuclear this week, both having over 39 points. Chase scored the 2nd most points of any WR started in this league this season, only behind himself in week 10 when he scored 55.4 points. Josh Jacobs chipped in 3 TDs of his own, and everyone else scored at least 9 points, including 17 from their kicker who sadly doinked in a game-winner for the Chiefs.

//             <p>
//                 This matchup was the 2nd highest scoring matchup of the season, with the 2 teams combining for 294 points this week. Contributing 38% of that total was Giving Me a Chubb. While this wasn't the most impressive performance, they still managed to clinch a playoff spot. Had they scored 25 fewer points, they would've missed the playoffs. Their defense wasn't any help this week, scoring -1 points. Nick Chubb wasn't great either, only scoring 4.8 points. The rest of their players put up enough points to get the job done.

James Cook did not cook this week, since Josh Allen did all the work for the Bills. Their best player this week was Chuba Hubbard. They didn't even leave that many points on their bench. This team will be looking to up their game for week 1 of the playoffs.

//                 This table looks so much different than last week, when 8 teams were truly in contention for last place. This became a two team race overnight, because the losing team will have 5 wins and 9 losses, and only 2 teams can achieve that feat since they play each other this week. PF are out the window, and it all comes down to one week. The simulations give League Loser Prophecy the advantage, but they don't know how many bye weeks he is dealing with this week. WalterPicks doesn't have last place odds, but if they did they'd probably be close to the reverse of these simulations.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//                 The playoff picture is slightly more clear than it was last week. All playoff teams will have at least 7 wins. The two teams with 8 wins are in, the teams with 7 wins can control their own destiny this week, and the teams with 6 wins need to win and need some luck on their side. The winner of the matchup between Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak will automatically make the playoffs, so that leaves 3 spots up for grabs. Costo Guys has a sizeable PF advantage, so even if they lost it is extremely unlikely they will miss the playoffs. That leaves only 2 spots for Youngster Joey, the loser of Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak, Fortnite Master Builder, Twin Bowers, and Kirk Thuggins & The Boys. Njorkin da Tenis is able to get a 7th win, but without scoring like 300 points they will not win the tiebreaker over any team with 7 wins already, so they are essentially eliminated in the same way Costo Guys is essentially clinched.

                Alec has reason to question his fellow manager, who released a trailer for his MotW video multiple weeks ago, with no release date. Releasing a trailer for a MotW video is a first, and league managers have no idea about the timeline of the actual video. Luckily Nikhil was able to win this matchup this week, or he would've lost 2 additional MotW's since this video was assigned to him.

                Anthony also released his MotW video this week, and kept it "short and sweet". One thing in his video was not short however.

            <p>
                One playoff format that some leagues use is reserving the final playoff spot for the manager with the most points, regardless of record. In this format Nikhil would've made the playoffs over Anthony. This doesn't make any sense for our punishment league, as Alec would've been 32 points away from making the playoffs while being in last, but it is interesting to note. It is also interesting to note that Anthony was outside the top 6 in the power rankings, and if we used those as a selection committee both Nikhil and Alec would've made the playoffs over Anthony and Devan, the two lowest playoff teams.

                Alec, who was on bye in the toilet bowl this week and didn't even set his lineup, would've beaten any team that played this week besides Greg. His team popped off and he scored over 150 points, with Davante Adams, CeeDee Lamb, and Terry McLaurin all going crazy. Davante Adams led all scorers this week with 42.8 points, and Lamb and Terry were 15 and 16 respectively. If only this performance wasn't wasted on a bye week, and could've helped them win one more regular season game.
