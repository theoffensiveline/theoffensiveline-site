                Week 17 saw the greatest championship final in league history, as well as the lowest scoring matchup in league history thanks to two rule breaking managers. The championship matchup came down to a MNF showdown between Jahmyr Gibbs and Amon-Ra St. Brown. Entering the Lions final drive of the game, Costo Guys held a slim lead, 147.42 to 144.88 points over Pink Pony Kupp. With the Lions leading in the game, it was unclear whether Gibbs would be on the field for the final drive. He ended the game with an 8 yard carry, a 4 yard carry, and finally a 30 yard TD run that sealed the game for the Lions and Pink Pony Kupp. This also helped elevate Gibbs to the RB1 started in our league this week. Costo Guys ended with 147.42 points, which was the #1 Best Loser this season, and they only left 0.3 points on the bench. They had the Biggest D this week, PHI, who scored 19 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now to the two rule breakers, League Loser Prophecy and Twin Bowers. These two faced off in the 10th place game, and mutually agreed to violate Article IV of the bylaws by not setting their best possible lineup. They set up a 1v1 kicker showdown between Dicker the Kicker and Jake (Master) Bates. Dicker the Kicker ended up scoring the most points of any kicker this week, helping League Loser Prophecy win the game, and be the Worst Winner in league history. Twin Bowers meanwhile was the Most Mismanaged Team and also had the Warmest Bench, leaving 103.3 points on their bench.

                The top 2 scoring teams were the finalists, and both managed at over 95% efficiency in the most important game of the season. Just Joshin pt. 2 had the worst management of any team who actually tried to set a lineup this week.

                Costo Guys put up a solid performance in the championship. Every other team this season who scored more than 147 points won their matchup. Malik Nabers was their best player, scoring 36.1 points in the Drew Lock masterclass. Lamar Jackson helped out adding in nearly 30 points of his own, and Amon-Ra and PHI D put in 20 and 19 respectively. They were let down by Nico Collins, Breece Hall, and Chris Boswell.

                Pink Pony Kupp put up 155.08 points in the championship, the most points scored in a championship game in recorded league history. Joe Burrow put up 36.98 points, which he needed OT to do. Jahmyr Gibbs, Bucky Irving, Jalen McMillan, and Brian Thomas all scored 23 or more points. They were let down by namesake Cooper Kupp and new-to-them TE Hunter Henry. Their K and DEF each chipped in 9 points.

                Calvin's Cold Streak scored the least points of any team who tried to set their lineup this week. Travis Kelce was the one major bright spot on this team, scoring 22.4 points. TB defense and Jordan Addison had the next best performances relative to expectation. This team was let down by Geno Smith and Alexander Mattison, and ended up losing the 3rd place game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 was able to get this win thanks in large part to Ladd McConkey, Bijan Robinson, and Josh Allen. They also got respectable games from Aaron Jones, DJ Moore, Chig, and their K & DEF. James Conner got hurt early in his game, leading to a dud from him. Third place doesn't win this manager any money, but they might get a sense of pride and accomplishment out of back-to-back top-3 finishes.

There are a lot of players bunched up at the bottom of their bar in the chart who scored 6.1 points or less. These players are not worth discussing besides Trey McBride, who had his worst game of the season this week. Their top 4 players put up decent numbers, but it wasn't enough to get the win in this 5th place game nobody will remember.

//                 Youngster Joey redeemed themselves this week after scoring less than 80 points last week in their first playoff game, but it is too little too late as this game only got them 5th place. Saquon was the MVP this week, but that mostly was because this team didn't put up a ton of points. Kyler and Jake Elliott were the 2nd and 3rd highest scorers this week for this team, and both their WRs scored less than 8 points. They were able to get the W in this game despite all of that.

                First Down Syndrome put up 130.14 points, their 2nd highest point total of the season, only behind their victory to avoid last place in week 14. This team nearly clutched up yet again, but couldn't score enough because of their RBs and DEF shitting the bed. The rest of their players did about as well as you could hope, with 5 of them scoring over 19 points, and they got 11.3 from their kicker. If only they got more than 5.3 total points from their RBs and DEF.

                Njorkin da Tenis was able to get the win in the all-important toilet bowl final. Jayden Daniels, Tee Higgins, and Puka Nacua came in clutch for them, and Rhamondre, Ferguson, and NO DEF disappointed them.

//                 This table looks so much different than last week, when 8 teams were truly in contention for last place. This became a two team race overnight, because the losing team will have 5 wins and 9 losses, and only 2 teams can achieve that feat since they play each other this week. PF are out the window, and it all comes down to one week. The simulations give League Loser Prophecy the advantage, but they don't know how many bye weeks he is dealing with this week. WalterPicks doesn't have last place odds, but if they did they'd probably be close to the reverse of these simulations.

//             <p>
//                 The playoff picture is slightly more clear than it was last week. All playoff teams will have at least 7 wins. The two teams with 8 wins are in, the teams with 7 wins can control their own destiny this week, and the teams with 6 wins need to win and need some luck on their side. The winner of the matchup between Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak will automatically make the playoffs, so that leaves 3 spots up for grabs. Costo Guys has a sizeable PF advantage, so even if they lost it is extremely unlikely they will miss the playoffs. That leaves only 2 spots for Youngster Joey, the loser of Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak, Fortnite Master Builder, Twin Bowers, and Kirk Thuggins & The Boys. Njorkin da Tenis is able to get a 7th win, but without scoring like 300 points they will not win the tiebreaker over any team with 7 wins already, so they are essentially eliminated in the same way Costo Guys is essentially clinched.

                Alec completed his 24 hour Fortnite stream punishment this week, from 8pm ET Sunday to about 9pm ET on Monday. During the stream, Alec earned 4 Victory Royales, consumed 1.78125 gallons of liquid, and pissed 24 times. Alec ended up with 84 kills for a 1.09 K/D in his games, and had 14 top 10% finishes, and 28 top 25% finishes. 0 dreams about Fortnite were had after 24 straight hours of playing. Alec also did an epilogue stream on Tuesday for a few hours, where he got a few more Victory Royales, and drank a few more seltzers.

                Some managers are saying the punishment was too easy, since Alec wasn't really feeling upset about it afterwards, and did another Fortnite stream the next day.

                This did seem like the easiest punishment the league has had so far, with Alec vouching that the ACT was worse than this. Whether the calendar or the 30 challenge were worse could be debatable, but this was definitely not as much of a punishment as some managers may have anticipated.

                About 15 hours in, Anthony joined the stream and complained about the audio quailty, causing Alec to attempt to reset the connection between his headset and his PC. This caused the PC to crash, ruining the Twitch timer, and the stream was not 24 consecutive hours of Fortnite, per the rules.

                Greg mentioned there are 480 reasons to care, and Trevor had received multiple congratulatory texts from other managers prior to this claim that no one cares.

                This anonymous manager also seemed to care about Trevor winning the league, or maybe cared more about Greg not winning.
