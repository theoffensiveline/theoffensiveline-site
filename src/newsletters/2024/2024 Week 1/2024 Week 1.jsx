            <p>
                Week 1 is the start of a new season, which typically comes with a few surprises, but this year felt like more than usual. The 1.01 CMC was shockingly ruled out 90 minutes before the game, and could miss an extended period of time with achilles tendonitis. Fantasy managers everywhere that didn't draft Jordan Mason are irate with the 49ers for the way they have handled this situation. This CMC situation is one reason that the most mismanaged team this week was Kirk Thuggins & The Boys. Many of the leagues managers were disappointed with this outcome because they chose Kirk Thuggins & The Boys in the survival pool this week, more on this later. SUN GOD'S CHOSEN was able to beat Kirk Thuggins & The Boys as the worst winner despite leaving a bunch of points on their bench. The best managed team this week was Cinderella, and they had the biggest blowout as well. Youngster Joey was the best loser this week, with the 5th highest scoring output of the week.

            <p>
                There was only one perfect manager this week, and they were also the highest scorer of the week. Four teams had the potential to outscore Cinderella, but failed as managers. It was a really tough week for Kirk Thuggins & The Boys, as previously covered. They nearly scored a nice percentage of their potential points. This chart shows that it might've been a worse week for IKEA x50crmov15, since they had the lowest potential points of any team.

            <p>
                These two teams faced off in week 15 last year, where IKEA x50crmov15 earned 7 shots/dogs, which were the most anyone did last season. Questionable eliminated themselves from the toilet bowl with that victory, which meant they would start this season with it as well. When the schedule was randomly generated, IKEA x50crmov15 was unlucky enough to be the other team in MotW yet again. They did the MotW punishment 3 times last season, and now they are the first one to do so this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                IKEA x50crmov15 invoked the corn dog clause and ate 6 corn dogs immediately after the Sunday night slate finished up, just in case Brock Purdy got below 10 points on Monday night. That 6th dog was not necessary, but Purdy edged that 10 point threshold in this one. The only bright spots for IKEA x50crmov15 were their RBs who both performed above expectations in week 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Questionable also had 5 players below 10 points, but the players above 10 points all had 15 or more, which helped them secure the victory. De'Von Achane was hyper efficient yet again, but did get injured in this game. Mike Evans did Mike Evans things, and Justin Jefferson did not seem too negatively affected Darnold at QB.
            </p>
            <p>
                The survivor pool adds a new element of excitement to MotW this year, as it is likely that multiple managers will have a rooting interest in the outcome every week. Two managers correctly chose Questionable to win this week, and 1 manager incorrectly chose IKEA x50crmov15 to win.

            <p>
                Josh Allen was QB1 in week 1, leading the way for Just Joshin pt. 2 in their victory over First Down Syndrome. Looking at Just Joshin pt. 2 you would think this is a keeper league, with Josh Allen, DJ Moore, Sam LaPorta and DAL D returning from their squad last year. They made a point in the draft to get their guys again this year. First Down Syndrome put up a respectable amount of points in this matchup, but it was not enough to get the W. Solid performances all around for this team lead of course by Tyreek Hill.

            <p>
                Twin Bowers is the reigning champion of the league, and starts of 1-0 in this new season with a narrow win over Youngster Joey. Youngster Joey put up a good fight this week as the best loser, and was a solid Marvin Harrison Jr. debut away from winning this matchup. Saquon was the overall #1 player this week, after Youngster Joey was upset when they drafted him. Twin Bowers had biggest D this week help them get the W, playing MIN D against his own Giants.

            <p>
                This game had the most drama of any week 1 matchup by a longshot. Going into Monday Night, Kirk Thuggins & The Boys had a decent chance to win with CMC in the lineup. Once CMC was ruled out, there was no way for them to get 20+ points since Jordan Mason was already on a roster. The CMC situation is not the only reason there was drama in this one.

            <p>
                Cinderella got a hard carry from kicker Jake Moody, the highest starting kicker score of the week. Lamar, Rhamondre, Breece, and Nico also added strong contributions. This team is dealing with multiple injuries after week 1 though, including Puka and Njoku. They were already rostering 2 injured players as well in Hockenson and Brooks. This team will be going through it over the next few weeks before bye weeks even start. Giving Me a Chubb struggled mightily in this one, with their top scorer also being their kicker, but at a much lower point total. The Ravens on this team didn't put up big numbers like Lamar did, and Mahomes wasn't great for fantasy in week 1 either.

                Cook-ing a 0.2 played the NYJ defense in this one, who put up a 2 on MNF, but that was the least of this team's concerns this week. Travis Kelce was not very involved in the Chiefs offense this week and Jordan Addison came down with an ankle injury. The bright spot was Anthony Richardson looking elite, but we will see if the long TD passes are sustainable. Pink Pony Kupp got carried by Cooper Kupp who had 14 receptions this week. Kyle Pitts had a TD which helped salvage an otherwise underwhelming performance where Kirk Cousins looked awful.

            <p>
                The Offensive Line has received multiple reports this week of managers intentionally excluding players from their starting lineup to bait other managers into choosing their opponent for the survivor pool. At least one manager chose Kirk Thuggins & The Boys to win in the survivor pool this week because SUN GOD'S CHOSEN didn't have their K or DEF in their lineup. This meant the Sleeper matchup preview showed a percent chance to win at the time of selection that did not reflect the true outcome. There were reports that other teams may have been doing this as well. At least one league manager thinks this is a shitty move.

            <p>Other league managers that have voiced concern about this strategy remained anonymous in their reports, and did not give any specific quotes about the situation when asked for comment. One league manager came out with the following statement backing the move:</p>
