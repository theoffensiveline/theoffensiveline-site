                Week 5 was extremely high scoring across the board, with 11 out of 12 teams scoring more than 100 points, and a league median of 125.22 points. These are both new highs for us this season. The 8th highest scorer (Poor Management) was within 4 points of the 4th highest scorer (Kirk Thuggins & The Boys). The top scorer, Calvin's Cold Streak, put up the third highest point total of any team this season, 148.36 points. This was led by Ja'Marr Chase who scored 41.3 points for the #1 WR performance in our league this season. Supplying Chase these points was Joe Burrow, who scored 33.78 points for Pink Pony Kupp.

            <p>
                There was one perfect manager this week, Just Joshin pt. 2, and 4 managers at 96% or higher. The highest maximum point total belonged to Twin Bowers, with a bench of Baker Mayfield (23.4 points), Chase Brown (16.4 points), and Jordan Whittington (15.9 points). The lowest manager skill this week was Cinderella, who had a respectable 80.2% of their maximum. They could've avoided their L this week if they had maximized their points.

            <p>
                Cinderella had Lamar Jackson go off this week, but that was not enough to hang on against Poor Management. Breece Hall, Diontae Johnson, and David Njoku really let this team down when they needed them most. Jake Moody contributed the 4th shot/dog after getting injured trying to make a tackle in the 2nd quarter of the game. He would've easily gotten over 10 points if he hadn't gotten injured.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor Management had good games from Mike Evans, Jake Ferguson, and MIN D. De'Von Achane and Dontayvion Wicks were disappointing, but Kareem Hunt and Harrison Butker (what an unlikeable duo) saved the day on Monday Night Football and secured the win for Poor Management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trevor and Josh K incorrectly picked Cinderella to win in the survivor pool to each earn their first strike. No managers selected Poor Management to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                First Down Syndrome was in last place coming into this game, and their outlook for the season was not looking great. They have dealt with injuries and have yet to put together a super inspiring performance. Joe Flacco was able to come in off the street and drop 26.56 points, leading the way for them this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youngster Joey really struggled this week, with their 3 WRs totaling only 16.4 points. Kyler Murray (Rotom) had a decent game, as did newly acquired Younghoe Koo (Flygon). Ultimately this team was one of the worst in the league this week, and lost their matchup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three managers incorrectly selected Youngster Joey to win in the survivor pool. Greg was eliminated from this selection, and Jake and Alec earned their first strike out of two. No managers selected First Down Syndrome to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                This was one of the highest scoring matchups of the season, between the 3rd and 5th highest scoring teams in the league this week. Twin Bowers was able to pull out a victory behind performances from Garrett Wilson and team namesake Brock Bowers. Deebo was the only true disappointment this week for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 put up a respectable performance but it was not enough to get the W. Aaron Jones getting injured did not help their cause, and neither did playing Cade Otton at TE. Josh Allen had another bad week in real life and in fantasy, and Bijan has not lived up to his draft capital at all this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                No manager picked either team in this matchup to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                This was the first week that Giving Me a Chubb didn't have their RBs go nuclear, but the rest of their team was able to do their part for once. This was a well rounded effort from Giving Me a Chubb, with only one player in single digits at 8.8 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hot Dog Enjoyer is now solely in last place, and was the only team to not score 100 points this week. Their top scorer was Tucker Kraft, and outside of him their team shit the bed. It's hard to win when your highest scorer is your TE and your second highest scorer is Terry McLaurin.

                Calvin's Cold Streak put up the most points of any team this week, led by Ja'Marr Chase's 41.3 points. Stefon Diggs put up decent numbers in his revenge game, and Travis Kelce is back to being a top TE in fantasy after the Rashee Rice injury.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kirk Thuggins & The Boys had great performances from Drake London and Tank Bigsby, but the rest of the team wasn't able to put together enough points to win. They put up the 4th most points of any team this week though, a respectable effort in the loss.

                Crashee Rice was able to beat Pink Pony Kupp this week thanks to great games from Tee Higgins and Brandon Aiyuk. Jayden Daniels and James Cook did their parts as well, as did DEN defense. Zack Moss got injured in this game, so that is something to watch going forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp put up 125.18 points this week, which was somehow 7th in the league. Joe Burrow was the QB1 this week, scoring 33.78 points. Sadly for Pink Pony Kupp, Tee Higgins was a direct beneficiary of some of those points. Xavier Worthy needed 24+ points on MNF for Pink Pony Kupp to win, and wasn't able to get there. He did draw a few long pass interference calls, so there was a chance if he had just caught the ball instead.

                This is a new addition to the newsletter at the request of one of the managers. I tried making this into a chart with everyone's team photo on it, but it got too crowded and was unreadable. Please let me know if you have any feedback on the presentation of this data. The goal from the manager who requested this was to see who has been unlucky with their opponents regularly scoring slightly more points than them. Those close losses are indicated in red here. Close victories are indicated in green. Any matchup with a margin of victory of 10 or more is not colored.

For example, Calvin's Cold Streak is 2-3, but they would be 4-1 with Crashee Rice's schedule. Twin Bowers is 3-2, but they would be 5-0 with Just Joshin pt. 2's schedule.

                The league office must do something about this to make sure that it doesn't happen again. Maybe Antonio Brown can be forced back onto the roster of the next manager who sends a gif of women's breasts. Or maybe Anthony's team will do something to punish him, like <a href="https://x.com/K1/status/1843351187170673149">sign on to a CoD partnership</a> (submitted by Josh).
