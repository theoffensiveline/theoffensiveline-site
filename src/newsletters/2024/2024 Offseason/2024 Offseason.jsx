            <p>
                In a developing story, the league funds have yet to be allocated where they belong, 5 months after the season has ended. We've received multiple alerts from concerned readers and local bylaw enforcement officers.

                "We're receiving reports of a Black Toyota Corolla with New York plates racing towards the Mexican border. It's estimated the driver is fleeing with a small fortune stolen from their fellow fantasy football managers."<br />- Austin PD

                Chief Correspondent ChatGPT was able to get a photo of the Corolla on it's way to the border.

                It remains unclear whether this is an inside job or not, but we reached out to the league office for comment on the matter.

                "The commissioners office is aware of the situation and is in an information gathering phase. No further comment at this time"

            <p>
                It is responsible for the league to take this stance without all the evidence available to them, but readers will have to continue to push if they'd like to see this story resolve.

            <p>
                While we are still waiting for last season's reward and punishment, next season is quickly approaching. The NFL draft is today, and the fantasy draft is only a few months away. There were a number of ideas floated during and after last season for new punishments, rule changes, and MotW changes. This article serves to refresh everyone's memory of them, and spark a conversation about what they'd like to see. Ultimately we will want to vote before our draft and buy in.
