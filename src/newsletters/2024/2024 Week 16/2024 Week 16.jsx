                Week 16 saw all 12 teams in action for the final time this season, and was very consequential for the championship race as well as the new toilet bowl punishment. 3 of the top 4 scoring teams this week were in the toilet bowl, with Fortnite Master Builder leading the pack scoring 166.14 points, the 6th most of any team this season. They defeated our Best Loser Kirk Thuggins & The Boys, who scored 141.32 points, the 2nd most points of any losing team this season. Kirk Thuggins & The Boys were led by the #3 RB performance of the season and the #4 K performance of the season, and Fortnite Master Builder had the #11 WR performance of the season.

                Costo Guys was the most efficient manager this week, only leaving 1 point on their bench. Pink Pony Kupp left the most points on their bench, but did not have the lowest percentage this week. Pink Pony Kupp left 36.7 points on their bench, at 78.8% efficiency. Njorkin da Tenis had an even lower 76.6% efficiency, but with a lower point total.

                Costo Guys was able to score nearly 150 points this week, with their 2 RBs combining for over 60 points. Lamar Jackson also poured in 20+ points, and all their WRs scored 13+ points. This team didn't get too much out of their TE, K, or DEF, but they got enough points to win this all-important matchup against the #1 seed.

                Just Joshin pt. 2 was let down by their QB and namesake Josh Allen this week, who scored over 40 points last week while this team was on bye, and only scored 11.16 points this week. Bijan Robinson and James Conner did their fair share, each scoring over 24 points. CIN D was the next highest scorer, putting up 19 points this week. This team was also let down by their kicker and TE, who combined for less than their opposing players on the winning team. This team will not be headed to back-to-back finals appearances.

                Calvin's Cold Streak was hoping to bounce back after a loss in the semi-finals last season, but couldn't break the streak and suffered their 2nd straight loss in the semis, this time at the hands of Pink Pony Kupp. Najee Harris put up a stinker this week, as did TB DEF and Travis Kelce. The rest of their players did about as well as or better than expected, but getting 4.2 points from your RB2 makes it tough to win in the playoffs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp got carried by the Falcons DEF who scored 2 TDs in their matchup with the Giants this week. They had been stashed on their bench for a while in anticipation for the playoffs, so the -1 bench spot paid off for them. This team had 4 guys disappoint this week, including 2 Jaguars players that should not have been trusted this late in the season with Mac Jones at QB. The other players who actually helped get this win were Joe Burrow, Jahmyr Gibbs, Bucky Irving, and the good Jaguar Brian Thomas.

                Giving Me a Chubb only scored 92.56 points in the quarter-finals last week, so they at least improved their score in their second playoff game. There are a lot of players bunched up at the bottom of their bar in the chart who scored 6.1 points or less. These players are not worth discussing besides Trey McBride, who had his worst game of the season this week. Their top 4 players put up decent numbers, but it wasn't enough to get the win in this 5th place game nobody will remember.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youngster Joey redeemed themselves this week after scoring less than 80 points last week in their first playoff game, but it is too little too late as this game only got them 5th place. Saquon was the MVP this week, but that mostly was because this team didn't put up a ton of points. Kyler and Jake Elliott were the 2nd and 3rd highest scorers this week for this team, and both their WRs scored less than 8 points. They were able to get the W in this game despite all of that.

                League Loser Prophecy was able to eliminate themselves from potentially having to write a song, something that it seemed like they were really looking forward to doing. Don't be surprised to see them featured and/or credited on the toilet bowl song that does eventually drop. This team had a well rounded performance this week to earn the win, with only IND D and Joe Mixon scoring less than 10 points. This team would've beaten 3 out of the 4 teams that competed in the playoffs this week, for what it is worth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Njorkin da Tenis had a big game from Jayden Daniels, but couldn't get enough points together outside of that to avoid the toilet bowl loss. Patrick Taylor and Quentin Johnston in the starting lineup is a great showcase of why this team ended up making the toilet bowl finals. This team has suffered through so many injuries this season, and might end up dropping a single because of it.

            <p>
                First Down Syndrome will be advancing to the Toilet Bowl Final after a sad showing this week against Twin Bowers. Their top scorer was Jameson Williams who scored 26 points. Their next highest scorer was their kicker Jason Sanders who scored 23.7 points. They had 5 other players who barely combined to outscore their kicker, with Hurts, Pacheco, Pollard, Pittman, and PIT combining for 23.94 points. Now if Jalen Hurts didn't get hurt they probably win this game, but sometimes that is the way the cookie crumbles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Twin Bowers was able to edge this one out thanks to the Hurts injury, which also caused Kenny Pickett to give A.J. Brown a 60% target share in this game. That helped Brown be the top scorer for this team, followed closely by namesake Brock Bowers who put up over 20 points for the 4th time this season. They didn't have any massive duds this week which helped them pull out the W and avoid the new toilet bowl punishment.

They only had their defense score less than 10 points, and had Devon Achane score over 30 as well.

//                 This table looks so much different than last week, when 8 teams were truly in contention for last place. This became a two team race overnight, because the losing team will have 5 wins and 9 losses, and only 2 teams can achieve that feat since they play each other this week. PF are out the window, and it all comes down to one week. The simulations give League Loser Prophecy the advantage, but they don't know how many bye weeks he is dealing with this week. WalterPicks doesn't have last place odds, but if they did they'd probably be close to the reverse of these simulations.

//             <p>
//                 The playoff picture is slightly more clear than it was last week. All playoff teams will have at least 7 wins. The two teams with 8 wins are in, the teams with 7 wins can control their own destiny this week, and the teams with 6 wins need to win and need some luck on their side. The winner of the matchup between Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak will automatically make the playoffs, so that leaves 3 spots up for grabs. Costo Guys has a sizeable PF advantage, so even if they lost it is extremely unlikely they will miss the playoffs. That leaves only 2 spots for Youngster Joey, the loser of Giving Me a Chubb and Calvin's Cold Streak, Fortnite Master Builder, Twin Bowers, and Kirk Thuggins & The Boys. Njorkin da Tenis is able to get a 7th win, but without scoring like 300 points they will not win the tiebreaker over any team with 7 wins already, so they are essentially eliminated in the same way Costo Guys is essentially clinched.

                If any CEOs are reading this, this is evidence that the best work gets done in person. The four losers and Nikhil met up over brunch this past Saturday, and this idea was the result of that brunch. How much Nikhil was involved in swaying this decision remains unclear to the media at this time, but this punishment league had a severe lack of toilet bowl punishment, so it is great that a unanimous conclusion was reached among the four losers. This sets a solid precedent going forward for future toilet bowl participants.

                "Tab for 10 at the strip: 120...It's a magical place"<br />- Josh Kraines

                A few league managers were at the strip this weekend, and despite their best efforts they were only charged $120 at the end of the night. This does not include the money that Alec lost to Matt playing Yahtzee, or the money spent on Dragon Ascent, pool, or darts, but the drink tab should've definitely been higher than $120. Matt also gave out some shots to the group when he pretended to remember us from 2-3 years ago, which was a nice gesture.

            <p>
                Nikhil had so much fun in Rochester last weekend that he already started planning for 4th of July 2025. It looks like we might have trouble finding a big enough place if we wait much longer, so everyone be sure to let him know soon if you're planning on attending or not. We should also plan in advance if we want to do something during that time to decide the draft order, as well as vote on any rule changes, punishments, etc. during that time to save ourselves the headache come Labor Day Weekend.
