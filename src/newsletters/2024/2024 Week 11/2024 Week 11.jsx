            <p>
                This is the 4th straight week that the highest scoring team has played the lowest scoring team, and the 5th straight week that the highest scoring team has served up the biggest blowout. This was the 2nd straight week that Costo Guys were the top team of the week, putting up the 4th highest score of any team this season. They played against the team that scored the 3rd lowest score of the season, Kirk Thuggins & The Boys. This resulted in the 2nd biggest blowout of the season.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had a pretty close game this week, being decided by only 2.82 points, 5th closest this season, between First Down Syndrome and Calvin's Cold Streak. First Down Syndrome was the worst winner this week in this game. First Down Syndrome got carried by the MVP and Tightest End this week, Taysom Hill. Hill scored 41.52 points, the #1 TE of the season, and scored 35.53% of First Down Syndrome's points, the 2nd highest percentage of the season.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best loser had 8 more points than the worst winner did, with League Camera Prophecy scoring 124.46 points. They lost despite having the #3 RB performance of the season, Joe Mixon scoring 35.3 points. They left 45.5 points on their bench in this game, so they easily could've avoided the title of best loser.

            <p>
                The Costo Guys were the best manager of the week on all fronts, putting up the most points at 100% efficiency. League Camera Prophecy had the 5th most points, but only had 73.2% efficiency. The 2nd lowest percentage was from the team in last this week, Kirk Thuggins & The Boys, who scored 80.1% of their maximum, but still had the lowest potential maximum points.

            <p>
                Youngster Joey was not a believer of the MotW Prophecy, ruining the opportunity for a Fortnite Master Builder victory by scoring more points than them. These points came primarily from Justin Herbert and Saquon Barkley, with help from the rest of their skill position players too. Their kicker and defense weren't much help, but they were important to getting the W as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortnite Master Builder had great performances from Bo Nix and Achane, both putting up over 20 points. They even got double digit points from the defense in this one, but their RBs were outclassed by Youngster Joey's RBs. Brandon McManus also shit the bed, only chipping in 2 points. Luckily they only ended up with 3 shots/dogs, but this will likely increase after another delayed video.

            <p>
                George Kittle out? No problem for First Down Syndrome since they've got Taysom Hill to fill in and put up an MVP performance in this game. T. Hill putting up more than 40 points for First Down Syndrome wouldn't have been too surprising to start the season, but the fact that it has only happened once and it wasn't Tyreek is very surprising. Jalen Hurts had a floor game with Saquon going off, but 18 is a great floor which helped secure the win.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calvin's Cold Streak didn't get enough points from their TE, K or DEF this week. They had enough points from their QB, RB and WRs if they just got average performances from their other players. Ja'Marr Chase and Josh Jacobs both put up over 20 points, and Najee, Addison, and Geno all put up double digits. They will need Kelce to get more than 3 if they want to win any more games this season.

            <p>
                This was a matchup of 2 6-4 teams, and only one could come out of this game at 7-4. Pink Pony Kupp was successful in that, putting up the 2nd most points this week behind 7-4 Costo Guys. Joe Burrow was the QB1 this week with 29.04 points, and Cooper Kupp and David Montgomery also put up 24 or more. HOU Defense also decided to drop 20 points after this matchup was already decided.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 only had Josh Allen go over 20 points this week, and only put up the 8th most points of any team this week. Bijan, Devonta Smith, and Aaron Jones let them down this week. Everyone else put up respectable numbers, but it was tough to beat Pink Pony Kupp without some boom games.

            <p>
                Brock Bowers got overshadowed by Taysom Hill this week, but he went for 31.3 points in this one, propelling Twin Bowers to victory over League Camera Prophecy. Twin Bowers also got solid production from Jordan Love, Chase Brown, D'Andre Swift, and his K and DEF. Their WRs were underwhelming this week, but luckily they outscored the other teams TE by 31.3 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                League Camera Prophecy got a huge game from Joe Mixon, but wasted it by leaving 45.5 points on their bench. Tucker Kraft ended with 0 points, and their benched TE Jonnu Smith ended with 28.1 points. That one decision could haunt them if they end up falling down towards the last place punishment.

            <p>
                Costo Guys absolutely dominated their opponent for the 2nd straight week, winning by the 2nd widest margin of any game this season. Amon-Ra and Breece nearly combined for enough to win this matchup, and Chris Boswell also scored 25.3 points, 2nd only to Jake Moody's 27.3 points for Costo Guys in week 1. This team could go undefeated the rest of the way and run away with the championship with the roster they've built this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kirk Thuggins & The Boys had an awful week this week. You can barely read their players on this chart it was so bad. Kamara, JT, and CMC were thought to be a deadly threesome, but instead they couldn't outscore Amon-Ra with their 3 scores combined.

            <p>
                Just a Hospital Ward put up the most points they've put up since week 5 this week, thanks in part to the players they were able to acquire via trade after their loss last week. They traded away James Cook and Amon-Ra St. Brown for Rhamondre, Puka, and Njoku. All 5 of these guys did well this week, and helped lead their teams to victory. Both of their teams would have won regardless, but this trade could have long-lasting impact on both the last place race and the championship race.
            </p>
            <p>
                Giving Me A Chubb did not have much success this week. Their highest scoring player was Will Dissly. That is not a recipe for success. Patrick Mahomes continues to be a bad fantasy QB, and they chose to start Noah Brown over Nick Chubb or Amari Cooper. Could this be another fall from grace this season?

This is based on the future projections that WalterPicks has, and accounts for upcoming bye weeks and matchup difficulty. The big differences here are that the projections hate Just a Hostpital Ward and League Camera Prophecy, and are higher on Calvin's Cold Streak and the bottom dwellers.
