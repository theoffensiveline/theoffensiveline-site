            <p>
                Week 4 in this league was a crazy one, with 3 close games and 3 blowouts. The #3 highest scoring team lost their matchup, the second time that has happened in just 4 weeks. This was a high stakes matchup this time, but losing MotW as the 3rd highest scoring team has it's perks. We saw the #1 MVP performance of the season this week from Wailmer, who scored over 28% of Youngster Joey's points this week on their way to a runaway victory. We also saw the #1 DEF and the #1 WR performances of the season, both from Cinderella's team to help them win MotW.

            <p>
                There was one perfect manager this week, Pink Pony Kupp. They had a respectable number of points on their bench, but they were mostly RBs who were obviously below their starting RBs point production. Giving Me a Chubb was nearly perfect this week, at 99.5% of their maximum. The team with the most points left on their bench was also the highest scorer of the week, an impressive feat. The lowest percentage this week was from Just Joshin pt.2, who was also the lowest scorer of the week.

            <p>
                As previously stated, Hot Dog Enjoyer put up the third most points in the league this week, a respectable 123.22 points. They only had 3 players in single digits, so they will only have to eat 3 hot dogs, something they will no doubt enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cinderella had 5 players above 20 points in this one, led by Nico Collins impressive 33.1 point game. RBs seem to be a problem for this team, but their WR and QB are set up for success. When TJ Hockenson comes back this team is a championship threat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kyle incorrectly "picked" Hot Dog Enjoyer to win in the survivor pool to earn their second straight strike, so they have been eliminated from contention. 5 managers correctly picked Cinderella to win in the survivor pool, and 3 of those managers remain perfect thus far.

            <p>
                Coming into this matchup, both teams were looking to avoid a 1-3 start to the season. Twin Bowers was the one who was able to do that, with an impressive victory over First Down Syndrome. They nearly could've won this matchup with just their 3 highest point scorers, Jordan Love, Jayden Reed, and D'Andre Swift. Those three combined for 84.76 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                First Down Syndrome had another rough week, coming off of their 64.44 point outing last week. Michael Pittman was finally able to do something with Flacco in at QB, but otherwise this was a pretty awful performance all around. Tony Pollard saved his fantasy day with a TD in garbage time.
            </p>
            <p>
                No managers selected either team in this matchup to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                This was the first week this season that Youngster Joey didn't face a team in the top half of scoring, and it ended up being the team that scored the least amount of points. Youngster Joey put up a massive amount of points from their RBs and WRs, and not much outside of that. They would've needed just their top 4 players to beat Just Joshin pt. 2 this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 only got more than 15 points from one player this week, James Conner. That is not a recipe for success, and they dropped from first place to fourth place in the standings after this embarrassing L.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikhil incorrectly picked Just Joshin pt. 2 to win in the survivor pool. They have been eliminated from contention. No managers picked Youngster Joey to win in the survivor pool.

            <p>
                This matchup featured the second and fifth highest scoring teams this week. It has been mentioned before in this publication, but Giving Me a Chubb has a very scary RB room that nobody wants to go up against. Those RBs contributed the majority of the team points yet again this week, and Kermit was the only other player on their team in double digits. If Davante Adams or Amari Cooper get traded this team could unlock a whole other gear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor Management was actually managed pretty well this week. Stroud, Evans, and Jefferson put up decent numbers, but it wasn't enough as their RBs stood not chance against the RBs of Giving Me a Chubb.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alec correctly picked Giving Me a Chubb to win in the survivor pool, and remains perfect through 4 weeks. No managers picked Poor Management to win in the survivor pool.

                Each of these teams had a player put up 0 points this week, but both managed to score in triple digits. Besides that goose egg from BUF, Kirk Thuggins & The Boys only had Dalton Kincaid in single digits. A well rounded performance, but didn't have enough big games to overtake Pink Pony Kupp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp had solid RB and WR production this week, with all of them having at least 1 TD. That was enough to get them over the hump and move to 3-1 this season.

            <p>
                This was our closest game of the week, and was between our 9th and 10th highest scoring teams. If Patrick Mahomes didn't absolutely murder Rashee Rice (Paul Walker), Crashee Rice would've won this game handily. Jayden Daniels and Amon-Ra St. Brown's big games were not enough to overcome the loss of their 3rd star player. They also had extremely disappointing weeks from James Cook and Travis Etienne.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calvin's Cold Streak continued yet again, only putting up 2.5 points. That did not matter though since their team was able to pull off the victory and avoid an 0-4 start to the season in this punishment league. Travis Kelce benefit greatly from Mahomes taking out Rice, their other players did well enough to get just enough points to win.

                Hot Dog Enjoyer made two trades this week. One of them was pretty fair for both sides, as Hot Dog Enjoyer took a downgrade at RB to get a solid TE to replace the awful Mark Andrews. The other trade was shocking to the entire league, and many managers dropped clown emoji reactions on the trade. Youngster Joey traded away Raheem Mostert, last seasons #3 overall RB, for Falcons kicker Younghoe Koo.
