                We have a new low this season, thanks to Just a Hospital Ward putting up only 61.58 points. This was their second straight week with the lowest score, and was also their second straight week playing against the top team of the week in the biggest blowout of the season. They have lost the last two weeks by a combined 163.06 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                After being the highest scorer in the biggest blowout last week, Fortnite Master Builder was the worst winner in the closest matchup this week. They were able to beat Twin Bowers by 1.88 points this week while scoring 103.82 points. This is the 4th lowest score of any winner this season. Twin Bowers finally had an easy game and they couldn't get the win. Talk about playing to the level of your competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 was the best loser for the second straight week, this time with the 4th highest score, going up against the 3rd highest scorer, Calvin's Cold Streak. Calvin's Cold Streak was able to achieve this victory thanks to the #1 MVP performance of the season from Ja'Marr Chase, scoring 55.4 points for over 40% of the teams points this week. They also had the #1 TE this week, Travis Kelce, score 20.4 points.

                This was a great week for management, with the highest points left on the bench was only 13.8 points from Just Joshin pt. 2, and the lowest % of maximum points was 84% from Just a Hospital Ward. Giving Me a Chubb was at 100% efficiency, and Calvin's Cold Streak was really close at 99.6% efficiency.

            <p>
                League Camera Prophecy's MotW win streak came to an end this week in an ugly fashion, losing by over 40 points to Youngster Joey and resulting in 6 shots/dogs. Their only players above 10 points were Brock Purdy, Joe Mixon, and Terry McLaurin. Everyone else cost them a shot/dog, and the only bench player that could've helped them avoid one of those was ARI D instead of LAC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youngster Joey had a monster week, scoring the 2nd most points of any team, and the 4th most points in any MotW game this season. If you said before the week that Saquon and DeAndre Hopkins were going to get single digit points, and they were going to start NYG defense, most managers would've guessed they'd be doing a record number of shots/dogs. Instead, all of their other players clutched up and scored at least 15 points, securing them the victory in MotW.
            </p>
            <MatchupPlot data={starterData} matchupId={4} />
            <p>
                As noted in the last edition of The Offensive Line, the MotW Prophecy is so back. League Camera Prophecy took the loss to Youngster Joey, pulling Fortnite Master Builder back into the MotW. Fortnite Master Builder can bring League Camera Prophecy back in if they can beat Youngster Joey next week. League Camera Prophecy will play against Twin Bowers in week 11 and will anxiously await the MotW results.

            <p>
                Besides Jalen Hurts and George Kittle, First Down Syndrome struggled to score points again this week, but that was outshadowed by the worst performance of the season from Just a Hospital Ward. This team wins when their players not named Hurts or Kittle do well, and they lose when they don't. They also had a -4 point performance from their defense this week, which is the lowest performance of the season from any player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp had a solid week this week, putting up the 5th most points in the league. Joe Burrow had his second straight week as the QB1, and their other players all put up good enough numbers. Jake Moody could've put up a Joe Burrow style performance, but he missed 3 long field goals.

                This was the matchup between the 3rd and 4th highest scoring teams of the week, and currently the 2nd and 4th teams in the standings. Calvin's Cold Streak is on a 4 game win streak, going from 2-4 to 6-4 and from 10th place to 4th place in the standings. Their top player this week, Ja'Marr Chase, scored 40% of their points, the most of any player this season. Their top 3 players combined for over 100 points. If Chase can keep having boom weeks, this team is a playoff threat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just Joshin pt. 2 scored the 4th most points this week, but that was not enough to get the win to move to 7-3. Instead they fall to 6-4 after their 2nd straight loss as the best loser. Bijan was the RB1 this week, but Devonta Smith and the Josh Allen stack with Shakir let them down this week. If their loss streak continues they could be in trouble.

            <p>
                This was the closest game of the week, and the 3rd closest game this season. This game was decided by less than 2 points, and the winner was not clear until the final play of the Monday Night Football game. A Matthew Stafford interception or De'Von Achane fumble could've changed the outcome of this one. For Fortnite Master Builder, their best performers were Courtland Sutton and Kareem Hunt. That is not a top duo that inspires victory, but everyone on their team put up at least 7 points, which is a solid floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Twin Bowers has had the hardest schedule in the league this season, and they finally had a game where their opponent could barely score triple digits. Sadly, they could also barely score triple digits in this one. Sam Darnold only scored 6.44 points in a super easy matchup against Jacksonville, where QBs have been dominant all season. The Vikings won that game 12-7 on 4 field goals. If Darnold even came close to his projections Twin Bowers would have won this game.

            <p>
                Giving Me a Chubb did not reach triple digit points this week, but they did manage their team perfectly with 0 points on their bench. It is a tough look when your maximum possible points is 99.04 points. Their top scorer was Patrick Mahomes with 16.54 points, and Tyrone Tracy was a close second with 15.4 points. Their WRs were not up to the task this week, only totaling 13.7 points between the 2 of them. This team has lost 4 out of their last 5 games after starting 4-1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kirk Thuggins & The Boys were able to put up an above average performance this week, scoring 120.94 points. Their RBs and WRs put in their fair share, but their top scorer was the biggest D this week, BUF D. This is the #4 DEF performance of the season. This was the first time this season that a defense was the #1 scorer in a matchup.

                Costo Guys put up the most points in the league this week with 146.6 points, more than doubling the score of their opponent. We were less than 5 points away from this being a victory that was achievable with only 2 players. Lamar and Chuba combined for 57.8 points this week, which was almost enough to beat Just a Hospital Ward. PHI D chipped in another 19 points, so it is still pretty to get crushed by a QB, a Panthers RB, and a defense. They would've also won with the combination of Panthers RB, TE, K and DEF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just a Hospital Ward put up the lowest score of any team this season, scoring only 61.58 points. This was also the only time this season any team has had the potential for a 7 shot/dog loss, and luckily for them this was not MotW. The only two players above 10 points were James Cook and Amon-Ra St. Brown, who they promptly traded to Costo Guys after this matchup.

                Costo Guys also reclaimed the top spot in the power rankings this week, which look pretty similar to the standings right now.

Twin Bowers has fallen down to 9th, which is the same as their standings position.
