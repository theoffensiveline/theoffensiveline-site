            <p>
                Did you guys know it was National Tight End Day in week 8? We had the #1 highest scoring TE of the season this week when Cade Otton put up 29.1 points for Just Johsin pt. 2. Other top TE performances included Kyle Pitts (25.1 points), Travis Kelce (25 points), George Kittle (24.8 points), and Trey McBride (21.4 points). You know it was national tight end day when the highest scoring TE outscored the highest scoring RB.
            </p>
            <p>
                The top scoring player this week was CeeDee Lamb, who scored a whopping 39.6 points, which was the #2 WR performance of the season. They were on the #2 highest scoring team of the season, League Camera Prophecy. League Camera Prophecy defeated Just a Hospital Ward by 62.96 points, the #2 highest margin of victory of the season. Lots of #2 for League Camera Prophecy this week.

                There were no perfect managers this week, but Pink Pony Kupp came extremely close, only leaving 0.48 points on their bench, for 99.7% of their maximum score. Giving Me a Chubb had the worst management of the season so far, at only 66.5% of their maximum, leaving a season high 50.84 points on their bench. They had the 3rd highest potential score this week and had the 11th highest actual score. Not much to get a Chubb about there.

            <p>
                In order to get Fortnite Master Builder back into matchup of the week, Just a Hospital Ward would have had to win this game. That was not in the cards after half of their team was injured in previous weeks, and they were forced to start players like Tyler Allgeier and Troy Franklin. Cole Kmet didn't get the memo that it was National Tight End Day either. The only 3 players that played well were Jayden Daniels (thanks mostly to a hail mary), James Cook, and Keon Coleman. This will result in 6 shots/dogs, tying the season high.
            </p>
            <p>
                League Camera Prophecy put up the highest score in the league for the second straight week, breaking the MotW prophecy along the way. They could've beaten Just a Hospital Ward with only 4 of their players, CeeDee Lamb, Brock Purdy, Joe Mixon, and one of Terry/Kraft/LAC. They became the first team to defend the MotW title this season, and have moved all the way up to 7th in the standings in the process.

            <p>
                Now here's a guy who doesn't have any help at receiver...kinda like Patrick Mahomes. Romeo Doubs and Amari Cooper combined for less points than either of the receivers on the bench for Giving Me a Chubb. Patrick Mahomes also sat on the bench in this game, and nearly doubled the starting QBs point total, as Caleb Williams couldn't even get double digits this week. In hindsight, that wasn't even the biggest mistake of the week. Starting Nick Chubb over Tyrone Tracy cost this team nearly 20 points this week. All around a tough week for Giving Me a Chubb, who just lost their 3rd straight game after a 4-1 start.
            </p>
            <p>
                First Down Syndrome had standout games from Kittle and Hurts for the 3rd straight week, and was able to get the win this time, thanks to the support they got from Tyreek Hill, their RBs, and their defense. Kittle and Hurts have been absolutely carrying this team every week, and that is unlikely to change, unless Tyreek Hill starts joining the carry too now that Tua is back.

                Just Joshin pt. 2 became only the 6th team to break 150 this week, putting up 150.02 points. Their only super disappointing players were DJ Moore and Chase McLaughlin. They had the top TE of the week in Cade Otton, and the top DEF this week in DET. The rest of their team put decent to great numbers as well on their way to their 6th victory this season.
            </p>
            <p>
                Costo Guys was the 4th highest scoring team this week, but that wasn't enough to win this matchup between the top two teams in the standings. Lamar Jackson and Rhamondre Stevenson put up over 23 points each, but Breece Hall didn't bring the boom as he couldn't reach double digits again this week.

                This matchup was between the 7th and 9th highest scorers this week, both teams finishing below the league median. Kirk Thuggins & The Boys got the win this week, lifting them up to a 4-4 record and the #4 spot in the standings thanks to their impressive PF. Kirk Cousins, Alvin Kamara, and newly acquired Jonathan Taylor were instrumental to their success this week. Brandon Aubrey had a down week after his jury duty stint this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortnite Master Builder lost their 4th game decided by less than 10 points this season, to fall to last place in the standings with a 2-6 record. They had 4 players put up respectable numbers this week, but were let down by the rest of their squad. Jake Ferguson was another TE that missed the memo this week, and Wil Lutz continued his "every other week" pattern that has plagued him all season.

            <p>
                Twin Bowers has a history of losing to any former residents of the Hubbell residence, and that trend continued this week in this loss to Pink Pony Kupp. Jordan Love getting injured didn't help, as this stopped him and Jayden Reed's scores from reaching their potential. Even if Love continued, it is unlikely those 2 make up the remaining points needed to take down the #2 team this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pink Pony Kupp had only their kicker and defense below 10 points, one week after having to eat 4 hot dogs thanks to a worse performance when the stakes were higher. This week over half of their starting lineup scored more than 15 points, with David Montgomery coming very close to that mark as well. Kyle Pitts was one of the big beneficiaries of National Tight End Day, scoring a team high 25.1 points this week.

            <p>
                In this matchup between two 3-4 teams, Calvin's Cold Streak was able to come out ahead and move to 4-4 on the season. They needed the points from most of their players, but most of their points came from Josh Jacobs, Travis Kelce, Ja'Marr Chase and Najee Harris. Stefon Diggs was having a decent game as well before blowing up his knee. The other team members didn't do very well, but did enough to help get the team the W.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youngster Joey usually relies on his RBs to score big to win, and that didn't happen this week. Saquon was the top RB scorer with 12.1 points, and had 3 TDs vultured by Jalen Hurts. Marvin Harrison and Kyler Murray played well, both scoring over 22 points, but they can't be the only ones cooking if this team wants to win games. Mark Andrews extended his TD streak for National Tight End Day, but that was one of the few highlights from this team. George Pickens nearly had 2 TDs in his MNF game, but ended up with 0 TDs instead. If either of those had counted, Youngster Joey would've won this matchup.

            <p>
                A few league managers wanted to try to get their eyes on some real football to try and get a leg up against the rest of the league. They decided to go to Europe in hopes of finding some football to watch, but little did they know football means something else over there. Their research trip was a waste of their time and money, unless they decide to stick around to watch the Giants and Panthers game in week 10, but that isn't likely to help them in fantasy football either. At least they will be able to dominate the 3am post-waiver free-agent market as long as they stay over there.
