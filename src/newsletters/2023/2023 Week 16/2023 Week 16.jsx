            <p>
                Week 16 was the second round of the playoffs, and there weren't any upsets in the top half of the bracket this week. Njigba's in Paris was the #1 team of the week yet again, putting up over 145 points for the 6th time this season. They ended the Cinderella story, but Cinderella put up a fight. They would have beaten either of the other 2 remaining playoff teams this week. Just Joshin got lucky yet again and barely won their matchup against Cook-ing a 0.2 to advance to the finals. We will see the #1 seed and the #2 seed face off in the championship game in week 17.

            <p>
                MotW continued tearing through the toilet bowl this week, giving out the most shots/dogs of the season. This is what you expect in the toilet bowl, but if you look up at Warmest Bench, things could've looked a lot different. This was the most points any team has left on the bench this season, and it's not even close. Tim's Team really dropped the ball on this one and it's gonna cost them. The other toilet bowl games saw The Werbenjägermanjensens and WalterFix lose and advance to the final round.

            <p>
                Tim's Team left more points on their bench than they scored, giving them a below 50% efficiency. This is by far the lowest of the season, and is presumably the lowest of all time. They had the potential to be a top 3 team this week, and instead barely edged out the worst team. Cinderella didn't stand a chance in their matchup, and there was nothing they could've done differently to change the outcome. Cook-ing a 0.2 however could've changed their outcome with some better management, or just one fewer injury.

            <p>
                Questionable won MotW for the 2nd week in a row while having negative points from their kicker. They would've been on the hook for 4 shots/dogs if Tim's Team managed their team properly. Luckily for them Tim's Team managed about as poorly as they could've, besides their kicker slot. Their mistakes put them into 7 shot/dog territory, the most of any team in MotW this season. These 7 shots/dogs are thanks to everyone except Justin Tucker and Rachaad White.

                Questionable will be taking MotW into week 1 of next season, hopefully they draft well. Tim's Team retires for the season, and will hope to improve next season.

                Cook-ing a 0.2 was unable to complete their 2nd straight upset, barely losing to Just Joshin. Just Joshin was without one of their Josh's in this one, but Zamir White was a solid replacement. They had a solid all around performances in this one from everyone except Sam LaPorta. Cook-ing a 0.2 had Jordan Addison and DJ Moore get injured in this one, so we have a classic what could've been. They also left points on their bench from the likes of Dicker the Kicker and Dallas Goedert.

            <p>
                Cinderella wasn't able to pull off yet another upset, losing to Njigba's in Paris. Breece Hall went absolutely nuclear in this one putting up 43.1 points. This was the third most of any RB started in this league this season. Cinderella finally played Calvin Ridley in a game where he went off, but that wasn't enough to overcome the deficit. Cinderella was let down by James Cook, Jaylen Waddle, and Dustin Hopkins.

                Hurt Thuggins & the boys popped off in this one to secure the 5th place playoff finish. Both of these teams did well when it didn't really matter for them anymore. Travis Swift was let down by Stefon Diggs and Travis Kelce, two players who have underperformed expectations all season. Hurt Thuggins & the boys was really only let down by their D putting up 0 points, but has nothing to be upset about here, besides the fact that this was the 5th place game.

            <p>
                The chart makes it very clear that this was a blowout, and in fact it was the 3rd biggest blowout of the season. WalterFix put up the 5th lowest point total of any team this season, which is surprisingly high given how bad this chart looks. They were outscored by E.T.N Phone Home at every position except for defense, and that's with an extra RB. E.T.N Phone Home had a statement game in the shit bowl after they earned the regular season punishment.

                First Down Syndrome has been able to coast on CMC and Lamar all season, just enough to never be worried about getting last place. Those two and Tee Higgins carried them this time to a win over The Werbenjägermanjensens. The Werbenjägermanjensens didn't do horrible compared to their standards, but this still wasn't enough to win.

                With many teams eliminated from meaningful fantasy games, the league has started brainstorming ideas for next season. Ideas have been floated for how to pick the draft pick pick order, how we can convert hotdogs/shots to other forms of punishment, and what we can do in the off-season to improve The Offensive Line. Any ideas should be submitted on the site or in discord so they can be tracked to ensure they are considered for next season.
