                Week 12 was mostly chalk, with good teams beating bad teams, and little change in the standings. This
                was the 4th week where Just Joshin has been the best team, the most in the league this season. This
                was also the third time that League Camera Fund has been the worst team, tied for the most with the
                other boom/bust team, Dropping Like Flys. This was a boom week for Dropping Like Flys with the
                Widest Receiver and the Biggest D. We had 2 near 40 points bombs from the QB and RB positions, on
                Just Joshin and Travis Swift respectively. Just Joshin also delivered the 2nd biggest blowout of the
                season to League Camera Fund, defeating them by a whopping 69.1 points. This is second only to First
                Down Syndrome's victory over The Werbenj채germanjensens in week 4, which they won by 81.24 points.

            <p>
                This week was really all or nothing with management, with only one manager barely in the 80-90%
                range. 4 teams had severe mis-management, but few of them would have been able to have a different
                outcome anyway.

                This wasn't the boom week we were expecting with no byes, maybe due in part to mis-management, but we
                did see in uptick from last weeks scores. This would have been another entertaining week if we were
                a league that played against the median too.

                Just Joshin had to be the one to break the trend of terrible scores in the last few MotWs. Every
                player besides their kicker and Austin Ekeler scored over 10 points, with many scoring 15+ points.
                League Camera Fund on the other hand only had 1 player score above 15 points, Trevor Lawrence. This
                was not a great performance from League Camera Fund, and they will have to do 5 shots/dogs after
                this one.

            <p>
                Bijan shih tzu was in the bottom cluster of teams for a lot of this season, but this win is their
                second straight, and they are in 7th place with the same record as 6th. If they can win out, they
                will very likely be a playoff team. E.T.N Phone Home was hoping to make the playoffs as well, but
                now they are just hoping they can avoid last place. This loss dropped them down to 10th place, one
                game ahead of last place. Their kicker and defense really let them down this week, along with their
                WRs. Justin Jefferson's return would be great for this team, but it might be too little too late.

                Dropping Like Flys had 4 really good performances this week, and that was all they needed to secure
                the victory in this one. C.J. Stroud, Isiah Pacheco, Tyreek Hill, and MIA D combined for 103.16
                points this week, &gt; 101.5 points. League Kamara Fund had disappointing performances from Joshua
                Dobbs, Cooper Kupp, and CLE D, but their bench wasn't much better. Regardless of their management
                decisions, they would have lost this one. Dropping Like Flys got the win they needed to stay in the
                hunt for the playoffs, and League Kamara Fund remained alone at the bottom of the standings with
                this loss.

                Last week we had two teams that traded with one another face off, and we had that again in this one.
                Travis Swift was able to take this win handily, thanks in part to former WR of The
                Werbenj채germanjensens, Mike Evans. Kyren Williams absolutely crushed it in his return from injury,
                and Travis Swift is built for the playoffs. The Werbenj채germanjensens are trying to avoid last
                place, and have had some decent performances from players acquired via trade including Rhamondre
                Stevenson and Cole Kmet.

                This matchup was a toss-up after the sunday slate was completed, coming down to D.J. Moore vs T.J.
                Hockenson on MNF. Ultimately, D.J. Moore had yet another great performance with Justin Fields at QB,
                and T.J. Hockenson couldn't overcome the deficit. Njigba's in Paris would have liked to get more out
                of Tua this week, but the Jets D forced him into his worst fantasy game of the season. Cook-ing a
                0.2 won the Eagles battle in this one, with Jalen Hurts having a huge game and DeVonta Smith
                outperforming A.J. Brown.

                League Camera Fund took a lot of the matters into their own hands, but allowed league members to
                build a parlay with some of the money. There was also a straight bet on Calvin Ridley TD scorer
                which cashed thanks to Bijan shih tzu benching him. There was also a donation to FanDuel of Jets
                -15.5 which sounds like something out of Calvin Ridley's Betting Corner. The league parlay consisted
                of D.J. Moore over 4.5 receptions (he had 11), Giants Patriots under 34 (they scored 17), and Josh
                Allen over 1.5 passing TDs (he had 2). This win turned $10 into over $50, and the bettors will be
                back at it with 2 $25 parlays in week 13.

                Dropping Like Flys is a known sandbagger, but has taken it to a new level this season. Every bit of
                news or opinion piece is just another opportunity to appear extremely worried about their chances.
                A righteous manager has confidence in their players to get the job done. Even after building up a
                massive lead and looking like a heavy favorite, they said:

                This sparked discussion that resolved with a no. Spaghetti-O's are instead the non-breakfast version
                of Cheerios, and also the Italian Cheerio.

                With fans on both sides of this game, and other managers with players in the game, the SNF matchup
                was intense. Many things were said, bets were sweat, and fantasy matchups were swayed. But the
                Eagles got the last laugh.

            <ArticleSubheader>Another Late Submission</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                The Werbenj채germanjensens missed the deadline for their video submission this week, and will have to
                do an additional shot/dog, bringing their total up from 4 to 5. If they were late another week, it
                would increase by 2 up to a total of 7. Another week would mean 3 more, up to 10. You get the idea,
                but some regarded managers struggle to comprehend the complexity.

                Just Joshin currently rosters 4 QBs, and doesn't have a playable RB on their roster for this week.
                They are playing against the current 6 seed, Dropping Like Flys. This matchup has direct playoff
                implications, and it appears that Just Joshin may be throwing to try to hand select a future playoff
                opponent. Should the league step in to force Just Joshin to have a valid lineup?
            </p>
            <p>We reached out to Just Joshin for a statement on the matter:</p>
