            <p>
                Week 14 decided the fate of the race for last place, as well as the final playoff spot. The race for last place was won by the underdog, E.T.N Phone Home. They went on a 6 game losing streak to lose the league after their 4-4 start to the season. This race for last place was The Werbenjägermanjensens to lose, and luckily for them Drake London was able to carry them to a victory in their matchup. WalterFix was also at risk of losing, and just skated by as the worst winner of the week. League Camera Fund was the other team tied for last coming into this week, but they put up another big week to ensure they did not have to do the punishment again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final playoff spot was earned by Cinderella. Once it was clear that Questionable was not a threat, Cinderella had a win-and-you're-in scenario, and they were able to get the W. Their game was the closest game of the week, and their opponent First Down Syndrome was the best loser. First Down Syndrome also left 35.52 points on their bench and could have easily won if they had set their lineup. Njigba's in Paris was the top team for the 5th time this season, and has been on a roll lately. They had the top RB, WR, and K this week, which helped them secure largest blowout as well. They are a top contender for the championship.

            <p>
                There was a lot of shitty management this week, especially from teams that really could've used their best effort. First Down Syndrome could've gotten into the playoffs if they set their lineup, and E.T.N Phone Home could've avoided last place had they made a few different decisions. Starting Love over Dak certainly was a choice, but that alone would not have been enough. Just Joshin had the lowest potential points for this week, but gets a playoff bye thanks to their cupcake schedule.

                As seen above, this week had a wide range, and a cluster of teams in the middle. This week had a much lower average and median than the past few weeks, thanks to bye weeks and injuries piling up late in the season. We also saw a decent amount of mismanagement, but not an unexpectedly high amount.

            <p>
                Just Joshin, the first place team and the team with the most points for coming into this week, will have to do 6 shots or eat 6 dogs after this performance. The only other 6 shot loss in MotW this season was Cinderella in week 9 when they lost to The Werbenjägermanjensens. Both of these teams put up less than 85 points in their losses. Just Joshin was let down by Josh Jacobs, Nico Collins, Ja'Marr Chase, Sam LaPorta, and Matt Gay who earned him double duty. WalterFix did not have an impressive week, but put up triple digits which was enough to get the win and avoid last place. They had a well rounded RB/WR performance, and got some stinkers from QB/TE/K.

            <p>
                All E.T.N Phone Home had to do to avoid last place was win this matchup against Hurt Thuggins & the boys. If you knew before this week started that they got 21 points from their D, 16.6 points from TE, and a combined 35.3 points from RB, you would have guessed that they had an easy win, especially with Jefferson coming back and Dak at QB with the Cooks stack. Sadly for them, Jefferson got hurt again, and they decided to play Love over Dak because their Eagles fandom got the best of them. Hurt Thuggins & the boys put up solid numbers, with big contributions from Saquon Barkley, Isaiah Likely, and Garrett Wilson. Their trades with WalterFix helped set their team up for success this week, despite poor performances from Amon Ra and Mahomes.

            <p>
                The winner of this matchup ultimately earned a playoff spot once Questionable didn't perform well this week. Cinderella wasn't the popular pick to win this matchup, but viewers would have expected a different lineup configuration from First Down Syndrome. Rumblings around the league are calling for an investigation into the decisions made by First Down Syndrome this week, and whether or not they were influenced by their opponent. Cinderella regularly jokes about paying people off, and if there was ever a time do actually do so this would be it. Playing Roschon Johnson over Kenneth Walker is a very interesting move to make. So is Brock Purdy over Lamar, but that one is a little less egregious.

            <p>
                After losing to WalterFix last week, League Camera Fund was once again at risk of getting last place. Their team showed up to play with their backs against the wall this week, but it didn't really matter with how poorly Questionable played against them. League Camera Fund had all but one player in double digits, and Questionable only had 3 players in double digits. Gabe Davis put up a 0, and C.J. Stroud scored less than 4 points before getting injured. Even Tyreek Hill only managed 10.1 points due to his injury. Both of League Camera Funds RBs scored 21.5 points, and the rest of his non-defense players scored between 12 and 16 points.

            <p>
                The Werbenjägermanjensens needed a win to even have a chance of avoiding last place, and Drake London made sure that they could get that win. He caught 10 balls for 172 yards with a two-point conversion to put up 29.2 points in this game. Cook-ing a 0.2 had a chance to come back and claim victory with his Eagles stack, but the Eagles were proven fraudulent against the Cowboys. If Cook-ing a 0.2 had played their recently traded for Evan Engram, Just Joshin's old team core would have carried them to victory in this one. Mostert put up 23 and Moore put up 26.8, with Engram having 32.5 points on the bench. They absolutely fleeced Just Joshin, and might have a chance to beat them in the playoffs.

                Cook-ing a 0.2 plays in the third Josh bowl of the season in Round 1 of the playoffs against Travis Swift. They are 2-0 against Travis Swift this season. If they win that one they will go up against Just Joshin, in the ultimate revenge game. The Werbenjägermanjensens will get a bye in the shit bowl.

                Njigba's in Paris went all out against Travis Swift this week, putting up massive numbers at almost every position. Their worst player had more points than Travis Swift's WR combined. Ezekiel Elliott looks fantastic with Stevenson out, and Deebo continues to have huge weeks. Brandon Aubrey had the game of his life putting up 24.4 fantasy points, the most of any started kicker this season. This team is a scary matchup every week, and is primed to make a playoff run.

            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "2em" }}>
                No, it's not inherently cringe to brush your teeth at work. Personal hygiene is important, and taking care of your teeth is a normal part of daily self-care. However, the appropriateness of brushing your teeth at work might depend on the workplace culture and facilities available.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "2em" }}>
                If your workplace has designated areas or facilities for personal grooming, such as bathrooms with private sinks, it's generally acceptable to brush your teeth there. On the other hand, if your workplace doesn't have suitable facilities, it might be more considerate to brush your teeth at home before or after work.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "2em" }}>
                Ultimately, it's essential to be mindful of your surroundings and coworkers' comfort levels. If you're unsure about the norms in your workplace, observe the behavior of your colleagues or check with your supervisor to ensure you're following appropriate etiquette.

            <ArticleSubheader>The punishment: 3 of each?</ArticleSubheader>
            <p>
                In a surprising turn of events, a misunderstanding has cropped up regarding the last place punishment. The standard punishment involves 30 total units of donuts eaten, miles run, and beers consumed. However, a mix-up has arisen, with some managers falsely believing that there's a minimum requirement of three units for each aspect. This misconception, akin to an old wives' tale, has divided opinions within the league, as some managers are now under scrutiny for spreading this false notion.<br />
                <br />
                Despite previous clarifications, the league is now dealing with the aftermath of this misinterpretation. The commissioners are actively working to clear up the confusion and reaffirm that there's no mandatory minimum of three units per category. The aim is to maintain the original spirit of the punishment and ensure that future seasons don't fall prey to the pitfalls of this peculiar misunderstanding.
